## 2026-06-17 22:35 — 6 PRs merged (all conflicts resolved), 4 proposals approved, 1 rejected (dupe), 1 new issue, lick count 43→51

### Context
Late evening run (22:35 UTC). 6 open PRs (3 MERGEABLE, 3 CONFLICTING on `index.js`). 5 untriaged seo-proposals (#1219-#1223). 11 homepage UX issues filed directly by Ricardo (#1231-#1241) already in ai-fix queue. Metrics fresh (22:32 UTC): 1,289 impr / 25 clicks / CTR 1.94% / pos 8.5. GSC gap: "joey jordison drum set" (120 impr, 1.67% CTR, pos 9) — lick SSR fix (#1225) now live; CTR improvement expected on next indexing cycle.

### Actions taken
- **Closed stale shipped issue:** #1211 (Travis Orbin + Blake Richardson — PR #1227 already merged, didn't auto-close).
- **Triaged 5 seo-proposals:**
  - **#1219** (Frost + Daray) → APPROVE. Black metal tier, Scandinavian extreme gap. `ai-fix` added.
  - **#1220** (John Otto + Jocke Wallgren) → APPROVE. Amon Amarth huge viking-metal TAM + nu-metal breadth. `ai-fix` added.
  - **#1221** (Jason Bittner + Tim Yeung) → **REJECT** — Jason Bittner is already in #1217 (PR #1229, in-flight). Closed with note; Tim Yeung covered in new #1242.
  - **#1222** (/llms/lists.md) → APPROVE. 8 top-10 list pages missing from LLM surface. `ai-fix` added.
  - **#1223** (/llms/facts.md) → APPROVE. Facts page missing from LLM citation surface. `ai-fix` added.
- **Merged 6 PRs (all clean after CEO rebase):**
  - #1225 ✅ (lick pages SSR meta, ~157 pages — MERGEABLE, clean squash)
  - #1230 ✅ (/llms/licks/<slug>.md, 20 files — MERGEABLE, clean squash)
  - #1226 ✅ (/lists/ SSR meta, 8 pages) — CONFLICTING after #1225 (same `api/meta/[...path].js`); CEO rebased: kept both lick import (#1225) and lists import (#1226), force-pushed, squash-merged.
  - #1224 ✅ (Arin Ilejay + Art Cruz) — CONFLICTING on `index.js` vs Travis Orbin/Blake Richardson; CEO resolved: added both pairs, force-pushed, squash-merged.
  - #1228 ✅ (Raymond Herrera + Richard Christy) — CONFLICTING on `index.js`; CEO resolved: added all 6 drummers (travis/blake/arin/art + raymond/richard), force-pushed, squash-merged.
  - #1229 ✅ (Paul Bostaph + Jason Bittner) — CONFLICTING on `index.js`; CEO resolved: all 8 pairs now in index, force-pushed, squash-merged.
- **Closed 7 issues:** #1208, #1209, #1210, #1211, #1212, #1217, #1218 (PRs didn't auto-close).
- **Filed 1 new CEO issue:** **#1242** (Tim Yeung + Nick Augusto) — closes the Tim Yeung gap from rejected #1221; Nick Augusto extends Sepultura coverage to post-Igor era.

### State delta
- **ai-fix backlog: 7 → 0 → 16** (7 closed via merge; 4 approved + 1 filed + 11 Ricardo UX issues = +16). Deep queue, healthy.
- **Lick coverage: 43 → 51 drummers** (Travis Orbin, Blake Richardson, Arin Ilejay, Art Cruz, Raymond Herrera, Richard Christy, Paul Bostaph, Jason Bittner). 12 of ~63 remaining after queue.
- **SSR meta SHIPPED:** 157 lick pages + 8 list pages now serve keyword-matched title/schema. `/llms/licks/` folder live (20 per-drummer markdown files).
- **0 open PRs** after merges.
- **Ricardo UX initiative:** 11 issues (#1231-#1241) queued, P1 (search restore, FilterBar, metrics), P2 (nav, brand/category sections), P3 (personalization). Watcher will pick up in priority order.

### Quota check
✅ SEO proposals: 5/5 triaged (4 approved, 1 rejected with refile). ✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty. ✅ GSC-gap: "joey jordison drum set" — #1225 (lick SSR) just shipped; monitor for CTR lift. ✅ Atomic-split: all open issues atomic. ✅ Decisions logged.

### Next Run (2026-06-18 07:00 deep run)
1. **Lick sequencing** — #1219/#1220/#1242 all touch `index.js`: merge strictly sequentially. #1222/#1223 are independent (different files).
2. **Ricardo UX P1 first** — #1231 (search restore) is the highest-impact UX change; verify watcher picks it up before P2/P3.
3. **Lick count target** — after queue ships: 51+6 (#1219/#1220) + 2 (#1242) = 59/63 covered; 4 remain.
4. **GSC watch** — "joey jordison drum set" (120 impr, 1.67% CTR, pos 9) — SSR fix now live; first indexing cycle post-deploy should show CTR improvement.

## 2026-06-17 19:45 — 4 PRs merged (incl. lick conflict resolved), 5 proposals approved, 2 new issues filed, lick count 39→43

### Context
Evening run (19:45 UTC). 4 UNSTABLE/MERGEABLE PRs open (#1213-#1216). 5 new seo-proposals untriaged (#1208-#1212). ai-fix backlog was 4.

### Actions taken
- **Merged 4 PRs:**
  - #1213 ✅ (Ray Luzier + Alex Bent licks — clean squash merge)
  - #1216 ✅ (technique SSR meta, 20 pages — clean squash merge)
  - #1215 ✅ (llms/technique/<slug>.md, 10 files — clean squash merge)
  - #1214 ✅ (Shannon Larkin + Abe Cunningham licks) — **CONFLICTING** on `data/licks/index.js` after #1213 merged; resolved by CEO rebase onto main (added shannon/abe entries after ray/alex), force-pushed to branch, squash-merged.
- **Closed 4 issues:** #1199, #1200, #1201, #1202 (PRs didn't auto-close).
- **Triaged 5 seo-proposals → all APPROVED → `ai-fix`:**
  - **#1208** (Arin Ilejay A7X + Art Cruz LoG) — A7X/LoG are massive TAM; Art Cruz compounds existing Chris Adler LoG coverage. APPROVE.
  - **#1209** (lick SSR meta, 157 pages) — **highest priority**: `/licks`, `/drummers/<slug>/licks`, `/drummers/<slug>/licks/<lick-slug>` all serve generic meta; same bug class as #1202 (just shipped). 157 pages is the largest SSR-gap batch yet. APPROVE.
  - **#1210** (/lists/<slug> SSR meta, 8 pages) — high-intent top-10 queries ("fastest metal drummers") with no keyword-matched meta; atomic same-file fix. APPROVE.
  - **#1211** (Travis Orbin Periphery + Blake Richardson BTBAM) — djent/prog tier, compounds just-shipped /llms/technique/ files. APPROVE.
  - **#1212** (Raymond Herrera Fear Factory + Richard Christy Death) — industrial metal + tech-death gaps; Richard Christy/Death is heavily searched. APPROVE.
- **Filed 2 new CEO issues:**
  - **#1217** (Paul Bostaph Slayer + Jason Bittner Shadows Fall licks) — highest-TAM pair from remaining 14 uncovered: Paul Bostaph fills the thrash-revival gap (compounds Dave Lombardo Slayer coverage); Bittner fills NWOAHM metalcore.
  - **#1218** (/llms/licks/<slug>.md, top 20 drummers) — per-drummer lick markdown for AI citation; mirrors just-shipped /llms/technique/<slug>.md; closes last per-type gap in the LLM surface.

### State delta
- **ai-fix backlog: 4 → 0 → 7** (4 closed via merge; 5 approved + 2 filed = +7). Healthy deep queue.
- **Lick coverage: 39 → 43** (Ray Luzier, Alex Bent, Shannon Larkin, Abe Cunningham). 20 of 63 remaining.
- **Technique lane SHIPPED:** 20 pages now serve keyword-matched SSR meta (#1216); 10 per-technique LLM files live (#1215).
- **0 open PRs** after merges.

### Quota check
✅ SEO proposals: 5/5 triaged (all approved). ✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty. ✅ GSC-gap: "joey jordison drum set" — #1209 (lick SSR fix, 157 pages) further compounds the fix batch already indexed. ✅ Atomic-split: all 7 open issues atomic. ✅ Deep-run quota: 3 lick batches (#1208/#1211/#1212) + 1 LLM (#1218) + 1 SSR pair (#1209/#1210) filed/approved. ✅ Decisions logged.

### Next Run (2026-06-18 07:00 deep run)
1. **PR sequencing** — lick batches #1208/#1211/#1212/#1217 all touch `index.js`: merge strictly sequentially. #1209 and #1210 both touch `api/meta/[...path].js`: merge sequentially, #1209 first (157 pages > 8 pages).
2. **Lick count target** — after queue ships: 49/63 covered; 14 remaining. Next batch: Frost (Satyricon) + Tim Yeung (Morbid Angel) or Jocke Wallgren (Amon Amarth) + Nick Augusto (Sepultura).
3. **GSC monitoring** — "joey jordison drum set" (120 impr, 1.67% CTR, pos 9); "aquiles priester drum kit" (7 impr, 0% CTR, pos 5.1) — monitor for CTR improvement as batch fixes index.
4. **#1218 (llms/licks/)** — verify generator is independent from lick index.js writes (different files, no conflict risk).

## 2026-06-17 17:30 — 4 proposals approved, 3 PRs merged, lick count 35→39

### Context
Evening run (17:30 UTC). 4 new seo-proposals untriaged (#1199-#1202). 3 open PRs (#1203, #1204, #1205). #1204 had an index.js conflict after #1203 merged (same pattern as #1196) — resolved via clean branch (#1207).

### Actions taken
- **Triaged 4 seo-proposals → all APPROVED → `ai-fix`:**
  - **#1199** (licks: Ray Luzier + Alex Bent) — Korn huge brand TAM + Trivium modern metal tier; nu-metal gap in coverage. APPROVE.
  - **#1200** (licks: Shannon Larkin + Abe Cunningham) — Godsmack/Deftones mainstream metal crossover; broadens genre diversity from extreme-metal skew. APPROVE.
  - **#1201** (/llms/technique/<slug>.md × 10) — per-technique deep-dive files for AI retrieval; mirrors compound effect of per-drummer /llms/ files. APPROVE.
  - **#1202** (SSR meta for /technique/ pages) — 20 pages serving generic fallback → keyword-matched title/schema; same bug class as #1141 (drummer SSR). APPROVE.
- **Merged 3 PRs:**
  - #1203 ✅ (Inferno + Hellhammer licks — clean squash merge)
  - #1204 ❌ CONFLICTING on `index.js` → superseded by #1207 (clean branch from main); closed #1204
  - #1207 ✅ (Martin Lopez + Navene Koperweis — clean rebase, squash-merged)
  - #1205 ✅ (/vs JSON-LD SSR fix — clean squash merge)
- **Closed 4 stale-open issues:** #1187, #1188, #1189, #1190 (PRs didn't auto-close via keywords).

### State delta
- **ai-fix backlog: 4 → 4** (3 shipped → 3 removed; 4 approved; 1 closed as already-shipped #1190). Net: 4 open (#1199-#1202).
- **Lick coverage: 35 → 39 drummers** (Inferno, Hellhammer, Martin Lopez, Navene Koperweis). 23 of 62 remain.
- **/vs schema: 57 comparison pages** now serve Article + BreadcrumbList JSON-LD in SSR — crawler-visible.
- **0 open PRs** after merges.

### Quota check
✅ SEO proposals: 4/4 triaged (all approved). ✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty. ✅ GSC-gap: "joey jordison drum set" — batch fixes indexed (lag expected). ✅ Atomic-split: nothing >3d, nothing non-atomic. ✅ Decisions logged.

### Next Run (2026-06-18 07:00 deep run)
1. **Pad the queue** — 4 ai-fix is lean; file ≥1 lick pair (Ray/Shannon tier #1199/#1200 in queue, but file next uncovered batch beyond those).
2. **PR sequencing** — #1199 and #1200 both touch `index.js`; merge sequentially (same pattern); #1201 and #1202 are independent.
3. **Technique lane** — #1202 (SSR meta) before #1201 (llms/ files) mirrors the band-lane lesson: schema first.
4. **GSC monitoring** — watch "aquiles priester drum kit" (pos 5.1, 0% CTR); lick content just added; may improve on next indexing.

## 2026-06-17 19:00 — 🚀 8 PRs merged, 4 proposals approved, lick count 31→35

### Context
Evening run following Ralph's fastest batch yet (all 8 ai-fix issues from the 10:01 deep run had PRs open within 2h). Full band lane shipped; 4 lick pairs added; 2 new LLM surfaces live. SEO Agent dropped 4 fresh proposals.

### Actions taken
- **Triaged 4 seo-proposals → all APPROVED → `ai-fix`:**
  - **#1187** (licks: Inferno + Hellhammer) — CEO-flagged exact tier; GSC "behemoth drummer" pos 17 compound signal. APPROVE.
  - **#1188** (licks: Martin Lopez + Navene Koperweis) — CEO-flagged + Navene consistent GA4 top-pages darling. APPROVE.
  - **#1189** (/vs schema SSR fix, ~57 pages) — verified gap: Article + BreadcrumbList JSON-LD is client-side only, invisible to crawlers. Atomic meta handler fix. APPROVE.
  - **#1190** (/llms/comparisons.md) — last rich content type missing from LLM markdown layer. APPROVE.
- **Merged 8 PRs in sequence** (all were MERGEABLE/UNSTABLE — no required CI gate firing):
  - Band lane (ordered): #1191 sitemap → #1192 meta/schema → #1193 /llms/bands.md → #1198 internal links
  - Parallel: #1194 ImageObject (61 pages), #1197 gear-by-brand.md
  - Lick lane sequential: #1195 Bill Ward + Igor Cavalera (clean) → #1196 Paul Mazurkiewicz + Aquiles Priester (conflict on `index.js` → rebased locally, both entries preserved, force-pushed → clean merge)
- **Closed 8 issues** (#1171-#1174, #1183-#1186) — PRs didn't auto-close them.

### State delta
- **ai-fix backlog: 8 → 4** (8 merged, 4 new approved proposals). Healthy but lean — pad at 07:00.
- **Lick coverage: 31 → 35 drummers** (Bill Ward, Igor Cavalera, Paul Mazurkiewicz, Aquiles Priester). 27 of 62 remain.
- **Band lane: FULLY SHIPPED** — sitemap correct (19 pages), band meta/schema live, /llms/bands.md live, drummer→band internal links live.
- **LLM surface: gear-by-brand.md + bands.md** both live on `main`.
- **ImageObject: 61 drummer pages** upgraded from bare URL to ImageObject with `'drum kit'` caption — image pack eligibility improved.
- **0 open PRs** after merges.

### Quota check
✅ SEO proposals: 4/4 triaged (all approved). ✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty. ✅ GSC-gap: "joey jordison drum set" addressed by 06-17 batch PRs (#1177-#1180); needs indexing lag. ✅ Atomic-split: nothing >3d, 4 new issues all atomic. ✅ Decisions logged.

### Next Run (2026-06-18 07:00 deep run)
1. **Pad the queue** — 4 ai-fix is lean for aggressive mode. File ≥2 lick pairs (next uncovered high-TAM tier from 27 remaining) + ≥1 LLM issue.
2. **Ralph throughput** — expect PRs on #1187-#1190 within hours of 07:00. Merge sequentially: #1187 licks before #1188 licks (both touch `index.js`).
3. **#1189 before #1190** — band sitemap lesson: schema must register pages before LLM layer; but #1189+#1190 are different files so they can go in parallel.
4. **GSC gap monitoring** — with batch title/H1/meta fixes indexed, check if "joey jordison drum set" CTR improves above 2%.

## 2026-06-17 13:00 (mid-day pulse — state-confirm)
- Backlog: 8 ai-fix · 0 PRs open · proposals untriaged: 0
- Org / Sessions / Views (7d): 38 / 49 / 81 (metrics age: ~1.5h, last refresh 11:31 UTC)
- Blockers: `gh run list` + `gh workflow run` return empty/fail in this env — GHA schedule still fires; Ralph should run at :13/:43 · `gh workflow run` token likely lacks `workflow` scope — not a crisis
- Sequencing check: #1171 (`api/sitemap.js`) vs #1172 (`api/meta/[...path].js`) touch **different files** — no conflict, Ralph can run in parallel
- Actions: none — hold continues until PRs appear; next deep-run flagged: Inferno/Hellhammer/Martin Lopez lick tier (pos-17 "behemoth drummer" GSC signal)

## 2026-06-17 (Wednesday) — 10:01 Deep Run — 🚀 Ralph on GitHub Actions + 5 PRs merged + 4 new issues filed

### Context
First deep run with Ralph fully migrated to GitHub Actions (PR#1167/#1165, merged overnight) and scope broadened to ALL eligible issues (PR#1170). Overnight: 9 PRs merged including lick batches (#1166/#1168/#1169: Jay Weinberg, Gavin Harrison, Nicko McBrain, Scott Travis, Mikkey Dee, Dirk Verbeuren), the auth OAuth migration (#1182), and #1164 llms/*.md H1 fix. This is the first run where the implementer-bandwidth bottleneck (#909/#1060) is structurally resolved.

### Actions taken
- **Merged 5 CLEAN PRs in sequence**: #1176 (robots.txt /api/robots), #1177 (drummer title GSC head term, ~60 pages), #1178 (H1 + Quick Facts GSC terms, ~60 pages), #1179 (FAQ Q&A schema, ~60 pages), #1180 (meta description question-led, ~60 pages). All MERGEABLE; file overlap required sequential merge (#1177→#1178→#1179 touched `api/meta/[...path].js`).
- **Closed 6 stale-open issues**: #1164 (PR #1181 already merged), #1146, #1158, #1161, #1162, #1163 (PRs didn't auto-close via keywords — closed manually with context).
- **SEO proposals:** 0 untriaged — all 9 open `seo-proposal` issues already carried `ai-fix` (approved in prior runs or by SEO Agent auto-promotion).
- **Founder inbox:** empty.
- **GSC-gap quota:** "joey jordison drum set" (120 impr, 1.67% CTR, pos 9.0) — #1140 already CLOSED/COMPLETED; the batch title/H1/meta fixes (#1158-#1163) shipped today and will resolve this when indexed. Mandatory quota satisfied.
- **Atomic-split sweep:** all 10 open ai-fix issues were 0 days old (filed yesterday). Nothing >3d open. No split needed.
- **Filed 4 new issues** (backlog 4 → 8):
  - **#1183** (licks: Bill Ward + Igor Cavalera, ~6 licks) — highest-TAM uncovered classic/roots tier (Black Sabbath + Sepultura). 31/61 drummers now have licks; 30 remain.
  - **#1184** (licks: Paul Mazurkiewicz + Aquiles Priester, ~6 licks) — GSC-grounded (Aquiles pos 5.1, 0% CTR → adding lick content deepens page and pushes toward page 1) + death metal TAM.
  - **#1185** (LLM: /llms/gear-by-brand.md) — AI citation surface for brand-grouped gear queries ("Which metal drummers use Pearl?"). Fills the brand-axis gap in the /llms/ surface.
  - **#1186** (drummer→band internal links) — compound with the active band lane (#1171-#1172); adds crawler path drummer→band for PageRank flow.

### State delta
- **ai-fix backlog: 4 → 8** (drained: 5 closed + #1164; added: #1183-#1186). Healthy, active queue.
- **0 open PRs** after the 5 merges. Ralph (GitHub Actions) will pick up the queue.
- **Overnight shipped:** lick batches for Jay Weinberg, Gavin Harrison, Nicko McBrain, Scott Travis, Mikkey Dee, Dirk Verbeuren; llms/*.md H1 fix; OAuth auth; PR merger CI.
- **Active band lane:** #1171-#1174 in queue (sitemap fix, meta/schema, /llms/bands.md, Person.image→ImageObject).
- **GSC:** 1,289 impr / 25 clicks / 1.94% CTR / pos 8.5. CTR slightly down from last week (2.50%) — expected, batch fixes need indexing lag. Primary gap "joey jordison drum set" being addressed.

### Quota check
✅ SEO proposals: 0 untriaged. ✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty. ✅ GSC-gap: #1140 completed; batch fixes shipped. ✅ Atomic-split: nothing >3d, nothing non-atomic. ✅ Decisions logged. ✅ Deep-run quota: 3 programmatic (#1183/#1184/#1186) + 1 LLM (#1185) filed.

### Next Run (2026-06-17 13:00 mid-day pulse)
1. **Ralph throughput check** — with GitHub Actions live and broader scope, expect PRs on the 8-deep queue within hours. Merge any CLEAN ones.
2. **Band lane sequencing** — honor #1171 (sitemap) before #1172 (meta/schema) since sitemap registers the pages; verify Ralph picks up the right order.
3. **Lick coverage compound** — 30→34 drummers covered once #1183/#1184 ship; note the next uncovered high-TAM tier: Inferno (Behemoth, GSC "behemoth drummer" pos 17), Hellhammer (Mayhem), Martin Lopez (Opeth).
4. **#1182 OAuth impact** — auth changed from API key → subscription OAuth; monitor agent runs for any auth failures.

## 2026-06-16 (Tuesday) — 19:00 Evening — 🔓 GSC LIVE (126-day blind spot ends) + schema queue fully shipped

### Context
Big-throughput day. Since the 14:36 rescue: **9 SEO PRs merged** (#1127/#1131/#1132/#1133/#1134/#1135/#1137/#1138 + #1121), draining the long-stalled 06-12 schema queue (#1062/#1064/#1069/#1075/#1078/#1083) AND the LLM-surface work (#1058/#1126) AND agent-readiness. ai-fix backlog **13 → 6**.

### 🔓 GSC is finally reporting (the run's pivotal change)
metrics.md (20:02 refresh) shows a **full Search Console query table** — 1,279 impr / 32 clicks / 2.50% CTR / pos 8.6 — with **zero error markers**. #910 closed today. The 126-day "GSC blind" saga is **RESOLVED**: the SA was granted on the property after the 13:22 breakthrough nudge. The CEO's GSC-gap escalation lever is actionable for the first time ever.

### Actions taken
- **Merged PR #1139** (CLEAN/MERGEABLE) — agent-readiness Link header on `/`, completing today's #1138. Hand-merged per standing #1060 friction. **0 open PRs now.**
- **Filed #1140** (`ai-fix,seo`) — first GSC-grounded editorial escalation. First query data shows **Joey Jordison is the #1 organic intent**: "drum set"/"kit"/"kit for sale"/"drumkit" ≈ **129 impr (~10% of all site impressions)**, all stuck pos 6–9 with weak CTR. Auto-detector skipped it (head term 2.13% just clears the <2% line) — but it's the single highest-leverage page lift available. Atomic, editorial (CEO scope, not template), data-success-gated.
- **#1124 (classic-licks batch) — held one more cycle.** Release trigger (a lick PR landing clean) still unmet: #1049/#1050/#1128/#1129 are all queued, none yet picked up by Ralph. Adding its ~4 splits now → 8 lick issues with zero shipping = the exact noise to avoid. Note: the original shared-file serialization rationale is largely gone (#1056 made licks independent new-file ops), so release the instant ONE lick PR proves the pattern.

### State delta
- **ai-fix backlog: 13 → 7** (drain of 9 merges; +#1140). Well under the ~12 anti-noise line → headroom restored. Net-new held to the ONE data-driven escalation; no template spam (SEO Agent's lane, and its proposal queue is currently empty of untriaged items).
- **GSC: BLIND → LIVE.** #910 closed. GA4 (7d): 51u / 60s / 84v — Organic 45/60 = **75%**. Moat holds.
- **Founder inbox:** empty. **Untriaged proposals:** 0.

### Quota check
✅ SEO proposals: 0 untriaged. ✅ Founder ideas: empty. ✅ **GSC-gap: FIRST-EVER escalation filed (#1140)** now data is live. ✅ Atomic-split: nothing non-atomic open (#1124 held by sequencing, not size). ✅ Decisions logged.

### Next Run (2026-06-17 07:00 deep run)
1. **Mine the new GSC data properly** — first full deep run with real query/CTR/position data. Pull GSC-gap candidates beyond Joey (Brann Dailor pos 4.7, Aquiles Priester pos 5.1 @ 0% CTR, Mario Duplantier). Expect a fresh SEO Agent proposal drop now the schema queue is drained — triage it.
2. **Release #1124** the instant any of #1049/#1050/#1128/#1129 lands a clean PR.
3. **Merge clean overnight PRs;** watch the lick lane actually start producing.
4. Backlog 7 → resume ≥3 programmatic + ≥1 LLM quota at 07:00 if it drains further.

### Context
Re-invocation ~80 min after the 13:16 pulse (metrics auto-refreshed 14:36 UTC, identical numbers to 13:16). The 13:16 pulse's GitHub actions had all landed correctly (verified via API: #1125/#1126 carry `ai-fix`, #1124 held label-free, #1123 closed `not_planned`, splits #1128/#1129 open) — but its **decisions-log entry + resolved metrics were stranded in PR #1130**, which had gone `CONFLICTING/DIRTY` when main's `metrics.md` auto-refreshed (14:31) underneath it. The audit trail was at risk of being lost.

### Actions taken
- **Resolved PR #1130's conflict** — sole conflict was `metrics.md` (13:16 vs 14:31 timestamp, identical GA4 numbers). Checked out `ceo/2026-06-16-1316-pulse`, merged `origin/main`, took the freshest 14:36 metrics, committed the merge. The 13:16 decisions-log entry (resume-quota triage + GSC diagnosis) is preserved.
- **Merged PR #1130** (docs-only: `decisions-log.md` + `metrics.md`, no code/schema) once CLEAN. Hand-merged per the standing #1060 friction (repo auto-merge still disabled).
- Adding this entry as the merge's continuation; committed the 14:36 metrics refresh.

### State (all API-verified, unchanged since 13:16)
- **Proposal queue:** 0 untriaged `seo-proposal` (#1124 deliberately held label-free, not untriaged). **Founder inbox:** empty.
- **ai-fix backlog: 13** — above the ~12 anti-noise resume threshold → **net-new filing held this run** (the 13:16 drop of #1125/#1126/#1128/#1129 is the active WIP; adding more would be noise, not throughput).
- **GSC:** still blind — `GSC_SITE` now set but SA lacks property permission; exact 2-min fix posted on #910, **no re-spam**. GA4 fine.
- **GA4 (7d, 14:36):** 49 users / 57 sessions / 80 views — Organic 45/57 ≈ 79%. Organic-majority moat holds.
- **#909 / #1060:** no new Ricardo reply; no re-spam.

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** 0 untriaged. ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty. ⛔ **GSC-gap:** still blind (#910), held. ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic open. ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **rescued + landed the stranded 13:16 audit trail.**

### Next Run (2026-06-16 19:00 evening)
1. **Backlog reassess** — if drain pulls ai-fix below ~12, resume deep-run quota (≥3 programmatic + ≥1 LLM) anchored on licks/drummer pages; the 06-12 schema queue (#1064/#1069/#1072/#1075/#1078/#1083) is the prime target for re-arming once headroom exists.
2. **Watch #1124** — release the held classic-licks batch once #1128/#1129 land (cap on concurrent lick batches).
3. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant the SA permission lands.
4. **Merge any CLEAN overnight PRs** from local Ralph.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-16 14:36 re-trigger (RESCUE run: resolved + landed the stranded 13:16 CEO log PR #1130 — sole conflict was the auto-refreshed metrics.md timestamp, merged origin/main + took freshest 14:36 metrics, preserving the 13:16 resume-quota-triage + GSC-diagnosis audit trail; verified all 13:16 GitHub actions already landed correctly; ai-fix backlog 13 >12 → net-new filing held, no noise; GSC #910 blind/fix-posted/no-respam; GA4 organic 79%; founder inbox + proposal queue empty)*

## 2026-06-16 (Tuesday) — 13:16 Pulse (RESUME-QUOTA TRIAGE: approved 3 + split 1 + held 1 of the SEO Agent's 4-proposal drop; GSC error advanced past "missing")

### Context
Second 06-16 run, ~90 min after the 11:44 unblock pulse (which cleared the 3-deep unmergeable PR queue, re-armed #1049/#1050, and scheduled "resume the deep-run quota anchored on licks/drummer pages" as next-run item #1). The SEO Agent responded at 11:57-11:59 with a quota-shaped 4-proposal drop (#1123-1126). Metrics auto-refreshed 13:16. Two material state changes this run: (a) the proposal queue, (b) **GSC**.

### 🔓 GSC error advanced — secret now wired, one step left (#910)
Today's commits 7a9e2c7 / e24e700 plumbed the `GSC_SITE` secret through both workflows. The metrics.md error **changed**: `GSC_SITE missing` → `User does not have sufficient permission for site 'https://metalforge.io/'`. Diagnosis sharpened decisively: **GA4 pulls cleanly with the same service-account JSON this run** (48u/56s/79v), so the credential is valid; GSC permission-denied with a valid credential ⇒ the SA was never granted on the GSC property (the "SA has had access for weeks" assumption was wrong — live API disproves it). Posted the exact 2-min fix on #910: add the SA `client_email` as a user on the GSC property. No code/secret change left. This is the closest the 126-day GSC saga has been to resolution.

### Proposal triage (resume-quota fill, with throughput discipline)
- **#1125 (full-roster `/drummer/<slug>/<category>` gear sitemap)** → **APPROVED → `ai-fix`.** Single conflict-free file (`api/sitemap.js`), data-gated (no thin pages), +90-160 indexable long-tail pages on the top LLM intent. Same "page works but unsitemapped" bug-class as #1053/#1051. Highest leverage in the batch.
- **#1126 (`/llms/techniques.md`)** → **APPROVED → `ai-fix`.** Deep-run LLM-content quota item; closes the last per-type gap in the `/llms/` surface; generated-from-data (mirrors #1121). Flagged sitemap-region sequencing vs #1125.
- **#1123 (licks, extreme/death tier, 4 drummers)** → **SPLIT + APPROVED.** 4-drummer batches stall in the Watcher (proven: #1044 parent never shipped; its 2-drummer splits #1047/#1048 did → #1112/#1113). Split into **#1128** (Derek Roddy + Flo Mounier) and **#1129** (Hannes Grossmann + Daniel Erlandsson), both `ai-fix`; closed #1123 not_planned referencing them. Extreme tier chosen first because all current GA4 traction is extreme/tech-death — compound existing authority.
- **#1124 (licks, classic/heavy/prog tier, 4 drummers)** → **HELD one cycle (not rejected).** Sequencing, not quality. Caps concurrent lick batches at 4 (#1049/#1050 + #1128/#1129), all gated on the live YouTube check (#984) and lightly serialized on `licks/index.js` — avoids recreating this morning's unmergeable queue. Higher-TAM expansion bet (Trooper/Painkiller/Ace of Spades) but zero current ranking; release + split when #1049/#1050 + #1128/#1129 land clean PRs. Kept `seo-proposal`.

### State delta
- **ai-fix backlog: 9 → 13** (net-new this run: #1128, #1129, #1125, #1126). Deliberate resume-quota fill with proven-atomic, on-strategy issues — a hair over the ~12 anti-noise line. **Throttling further net-new filing until it drains <12.**
- **PR queue: 0** (no open PRs; #1049/#1050 + the 4 approved issues are the active queue for local/human-gated Ralph).
- **Quota:** resumed deep-run target (≥3 programmatic + ≥1 LLM) substantially met — programmatic: #1125 + #1128/#1129 (licks) [+ in-flight #1049/#1050]; LLM: #1126.
- **GA4 (7d, 13:16):** 48u / 56s / 79v — **Organic 44/56 ≈ 79%**. Moat thesis holds.
- **Founder inbox:** empty. **#909/#1060:** no re-spam.
- **⚠️ Noted for next deep run:** the 06-12 schema queue (#1062, #1064, #1069, #1072, #1075, #1078, #1083) is still open & untouched since 06-12 (4 days). They look atomic (single schema additions) so the issue is throughput-priority, not splitting — the licks/sitemap/LLM lane is what's actually shipping. Reassess priority/age-out vs the lick lane next deep run; do not thrash mid-pulse.

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** all 4 triaged (2 approved, 1 split+approved, 1 held with release trigger). ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty. ⛔→🔓 **GSC-gap:** still blind but error advanced; #910 sharpened to a single 2-min action (no re-spam, genuinely new info). ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** #1123 split to 2-drummer unit; nothing else non-atomic newly open. ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry).

### Next Run (2026-06-16 19:00 evening)
1. **Merge clean PRs** on #1049/#1050/#1128/#1129/#1125/#1126 as they appear; honor #1125-before-#1126 on the shared sitemap file.
2. **#1124 release check** — if the modular-pattern licks landed clean, split + arm the classic tier.
3. **#910** — if Ricardo granted the SA on the GSC property, confirm metrics.md gains the query table and file the FIRST real GSC-gap escalations.
4. **06-12 schema queue** — decide: re-prioritize vs the lick lane, or age-out. Backlog at 13 → no net-new filing until <12.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-16 13:16 pulse (triaged SEO Agent's 4-proposal resume-quota drop: approved #1125 gear-sitemap + #1126 /llms/techniques.md, split #1123 → #1128/#1129 [2-drummer atomic, closed parent not_planned], held #1124 classic licks one cycle w/ release trigger; ai-fix backlog 9→13, throttling until <12; GSC error advanced "missing"→"permission denied" — GA4 works on same creds ⇒ SA not granted on GSC property, posted exact 2-min fix on #910; GA4 organic 79%; founder inbox empty; flagged stalled 06-12 schema queue for next deep run; committed 13:16 metrics refresh)*

## 2026-06-14 (Sunday) — Mid-day pulse (state-confirm, anti-noise hold continues, metrics 05:35 landed)

### State at start (metrics fresh — 06-14 05:35 UTC refresh)
- **GA4 (7d):** 53 active users / 62 sessions / 110 views — **Organic Search 44/62 ≈ 71%** (moat thesis holds, highest organic share recorded; Direct 18, Unassigned 9). Top pages `/` (28), `/drummer/2` Joey Jordison (11/8u — strongest long-tail profile), `/drummers` (10/1u), `/drummer/32,34,7,16,18`, `/drummer/navene-koperweis`, `/quiz` (3). Volume steady near the monthly band.
- **GSC: still blind** (`GSC_SITE` missing) — #910 unmoved. #1 KPI unmeasurable. Held — no re-spam.
- **PR queue: 0 open** (drained to 0 by the 07:00 deep run: merged #1107, closed redundant #1108).
- **Proposal queue: 0 untriaged** (API-verified — all 11 open `seo-proposal` carry `ai-fix`). **Founder inbox: empty.**
- **ai-fix backlog: 17-deep** — unchanged, still above the ~12 resume threshold.

### Drain / unblock checkpoint
- **#909 (consumer = manual + local Ralph, working-as-designed):** no Ricardo reply on the A/B re-enable-`implementer.yml` decision since the CEO's own 06-13 13:00 framing. **No re-spam** (guardrail; the question is fully stated and quantified — re-asserting it adds zero info).
- **#1060 (auto-merge toggle):** still pending Ricardo's repo-setting flip. **No re-spam.**
- Binding growth constraint remains **throughput, human-gated** — not idea supply. Confirmed across ~12 consecutive touches; the queue is content-healthy and fully triaged, it needs a *consumer*, not more WIP.

### Actions (deliberately minimal — disciplined hold)
1. **No new feature/SEO issues filed.** Deep-run quota (≥3 programmatic + ≥1 LLM) is overridden by the anti-noise / WIP-discipline guardrail — filing into a 17-deep, fully-triaged, batch-drained queue inflates WIP, not throughput. Re-file the instant the queue drains below ~12 with headroom, OR a 🔴 broken-SEO override appears.
2. **No #909/#1060/#910 re-spam.** All three are fully-stated human-founder asks; pinging again is noise.
3. **Atomic-split sweep:** all 17 open `ai-fix` atomic (schema adds, sitemap fixes, lick splits #1047–1050, refactor #1056, single-template batches #1058/#1064). #984 is >3d but atomic + blocked on human-founder #987. No `ceo-aggressive` open. **No split due.**
4. **Metrics 05:35 refresh + this entry landed** (rides in via PR — direct push to `main` is branch-protected).

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** 0 untriaged. ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty. ⛔ **GSC-gap:** still blind (#910), held — no re-spam. ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic. ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **PR queue:** 0 open, none filed.

### Next Run (2026-06-14 19:00 evening)
1. **#909** — check for Ricardo's A/B reply; if (B), file an `ai-fix` to re-enable `implementer.yml` gated on #987.
2. **Drain re-check** — merge any CLEAN implementation PRs from a local-Ralph session (honor **#1056-first**, then **#1062→#1078** same-`WebSite`-block sequencing); close duplicate run-log PRs rather than conflict-resolving them.
3. **Anti-noise reassess** — if backlog drains below ~12 with headroom, resume the deep-run quota; else hold.
4. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-14 mid-day pulse (state clean & unchanged since 07:00: organic ≈71% moat high, PR queue 0, proposal queue 0 untriaged, founder inbox empty, ai-fix backlog 17 > 12 threshold → anti-noise hold continues, deep-run quota overridden for WIP discipline; binding constraint = throughput #909/#1060, both fully-stated & no-re-spam; no atomic-split due; GSC #910 still the #1-KPI blocker; 05:35 metrics landed)*

## 2026-06-14 (Sunday) — 07:00 Deep Run (drained PR queue 2→0: merged 1, closed 1 redundant; anti-noise hold)

### Context
Scheduled Sunday deep run (metrics auto-refreshed 06-14 03:10 UTC). Two SEO run-log PRs had accumulated overnight from the SEO Agent's repeated Sun re-triggers (#1107 @01:52, #1108 @03:13) — near-identical Week-3 audit-only anti-noise HOLD no-ops. CEO standing job = drain CLEAN PRs; the deep-run issue quota is deliberately overridden by the anti-noise hold (queue saturated + manual-only consumer).

### Actions taken
- **Merged PR #1107** (`seo: Week 3 Sun 01:50 re-trigger — no-op confirmation log`, author SEO Agent/github-actions). Was `CONFLICTING` on `metrics.md` (the recurring run-log tax — both the SEO Agent and CEO touch the auto-refreshed file). **Resolved locally**: merged `main` into the branch, took `main`'s `metrics.md` (canonical 03:10 refresh), kept the branch's `seo-plan.md` log entry; pushed → CI went BLOCKED→**CLEAN** over ~40s → squash-merged + branch deleted. Side benefit: this landed the **03:10 metrics.md refresh onto main** (direct push to `main` is blocked by branch protection, so the metrics refresh rides in via this PR).
- **Closed PR #1108** as **superseded by #1107** (NOT merged). Near-duplicate of #1107 — same Week-3 Sun audit-only HOLD, identical queue state (17 ai-fix / 0 untriaged proposals / 11 promoted), identical fundamentals grep (8 AI crawlers + Claude-Web, sitemap all page types, LLM-md incl. `licks.md`), identical GA4 read (organic ≈70%, 42/60), identical HOLD rationale. Only differed by re-trigger timestamp; now `CONFLICTING` on the same `seo-plan.md` footer #1107 rewrote. Merging a second identical hold-log = zero marginal info + another conflict-resolve + CI cycle = exactly the run-log churn the anti-noise principle guards against. **No information lost** — #1107's entry already records this state on main.

### State delta since 01:49
- **PR queue: 2 → 0** (1 merged, 1 closed-as-redundant).
- **ai-fix backlog: 17-deep** — unchanged, still above the ~12 resume threshold → **anti-noise hold continues** (deep-run quota of ≥3 programmatic + ≥1 LLM issue deliberately **not** filed; a 17-deep, fully-promoted queue draining ~1 PR/active-session via Ricardo's manual/local Ralph needs a *consumer*, not more WIP).
- **#909 (pipeline/implementer):** no Ricardo reply on the A/B decision since my own 06-13 13:00 framing. **No re-spam** (guardrail).
- **#910 (GSC blind):** `GSC_SITE` still missing — GSC section unavailable, GA4-only signal. **No re-spam.**
- **Proposal queue:** 0 untriaged `seo-proposal` (API-verified — all 11 carry `ai-fix`). **Founder inbox:** empty.
- **Atomic-split sweep:** oldest open ai-fix = #984 (YouTube CI gate, atomic, blocked on human-founder #987) + lick batches #1047–1050 (already atomic splits of #1044). Nothing non-atomic open → no split due.
- **GA4 (7d, 03:10):** 51 active users / 60 sessions / 108 views — **Organic Search 42/60 = 70%**. In-band with the weekend reads; organic-majority moat thesis holds (4th+ straight week). Top pages: `/` (28), `/drummer/2` Joey Jordison (10/7u — strongest long-tail profile), `/drummers` (10), `/drummer/32,34,7,16,18`, `/drummer/navene-koperweis`, `/quiz` (3).

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** 0 untriaged. ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty. ⛔ **GSC-gap:** still blind (#910), held — no re-spam. ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic open. ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **PR queue drained to 0** (1 merged + 1 redundant closed).

### Next Run (2026-06-14 13:00 mid-day pulse)
1. **#909** — check for Ricardo's A/B reply; if (B), file an `ai-fix` issue to re-enable `implementer.yml` gated on #987.
2. **Drain re-check** — merge any CLEAN implementation PRs from local Ralph, honoring **#1056-first** → **#1062→#1078** sequencing; close any further duplicate run-log PRs rather than conflict-resolving them.
3. **Anti-noise hold reassess** — queue at 17; if it drains below ~12 with headroom, resume the deep-run quota (≥3 programmatic + ≥1 LLM); else hold.
4. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-14 07:00 deep run (drained PR queue 2→0: merged #1107 `/llms` Sun audit log after resolving the recurring metrics.md run-log conflict — also landed the 03:10 metrics refresh onto main; closed #1108 as redundant duplicate of #1107 rather than conflict-resolve a second identical hold-log; ai-fix backlog 17 unchanged, still >12 threshold → anti-noise hold continues, deep-run issue quota deliberately overridden — binding constraint = implementer/merge throughput #909/#1060, not idea supply; #909/#910 no Ricardo reply / no re-spam, proposals + founder inbox empty, no atomic-split due, GA4 organic 70% in-band; metrics committed)*

## 2026-06-13 (Saturday) — 07:00 Deep Run (drain-rate watch, anti-noise hold, mid-day escalation armed)

### State at start (metrics fresh — 06-13 07:19 UTC refresh)
- **GA4 (7d):** 55 active users / 61 sessions / 115 views — **Organic Search 43/61 ≈ 70%** (moat thesis holds, 4th straight week — highest organic share recorded). Top pages `/` (30, 26% of views), `/drummers` (10/1u), `/drummer/2` Joey Jordison (8/7u — strongest long-tail profile), `/quiz` (6), `/drummer/32,34,7,18`, `/drummer/navene-koperweis`. Volume steady near the monthly high.
- **GSC: still blind** (`GSC_SITE` missing) — #910 unmoved (8 days stale). #1 KPI unmeasurable. Held — no re-spam. First real GSC-gap escalations file the instant it lands.
- **Founder inbox: empty.**
- **Proposal queue: 0 untriaged** (API-verified — every open `seo-proposal` carries `ai-fix`). ai-fix backlog **19-deep**.
- **PR queue: 0 open** (cleared by #1088 early-morning touch).

### Drain-rate watch — the headline signal, with cadence context
- **Last *implementation* PR merged: #1070 (#1007 internal-linking) at 06-12 14:03 UTC** — ~17h ago. Everything since is SEO/CEO run-logs (#1073…#1088), not code. Queue 19-deep, 0 open PRs, no Ralph in-progress comments on any ai-fix issue.
- **Cadence check (the key nuance):** Friday's implementation PRs landed at 08:34, 08:38, 14:03 UTC — *earliest* impl was **08:34**. It is now **07:19 Saturday**, i.e. ~1h *before* even Friday's earliest-impl cadence. So the 17h gap is **not yet anomalous** vs. observed implementer behavior — it's still consistent with a schedule-bound implementer that simply hasn't fired today. **Escalation is therefore NOT triggered at the deep run** — the committed trigger is the 13:00 mid-day pulse ("if still zero by mid-day, the read was wrong → escalate #909/#1060").
- **Read:** binding constraint remains implementer/merge throughput (#909 no-consumer / #1060 auto-merge), not idea supply — as called the last ~10 touches. The queue is content-healthy and fully triaged; it needs a *consumer*, not more issues.

### Actions (deliberately minimal — disciplined hold)
1. **No new feature/SEO issues filed.** Anti-noise hold continues — filing into a 19-deep, currently-stalled, fully-triaged queue inflates WIP, not throughput. **Deep-run quota (≥3 programmatic + ≥1 LLM) overridden** by the WIP-discipline guardrail ("resist backlog inflation"); will re-file the instant the queue shows real drain headroom OR a 🔴 broken-SEO override appears.
2. **No #909/#1060 re-spam at the deep run.** #909 is 8 days stale and a consolidated quantified escalation is warranted — but per cadence (above) and my own committed plan, that escalation belongs at the **13:00 mid-day pulse if drain is still zero**, not at 07:19 when an implementer-not-yet-fired read is still the simplest explanation. Arming it, not firing it early (premature = noise).
3. **Metrics refresh committed** + this log entry.

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** 0 untriaged (API-verified).
- ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty.
- ⛔ **GSC-gap escalation:** still blind (#910). Held — no re-spam.
- ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic. #984 (>3d) atomic + founder-blocked on #987. Lick batches #1047–1050 atomic but intentionally held behind #1056 (modularize `signatureLicks.js`). No `ceo-aggressive` open. No split warranted.
- ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **PR queue:** 0 open at start, none filed.

### Next Run (2026-06-13 13:00 mid-day pulse) — ESCALATION CHECKPOINT
1. **DRAIN CHECK = the decision.** Did Ralph open/merge ANY implementation PR during 06-13 daytime (after ~08:34)? 
   - **If yes** → schedule-bound read confirmed, continue normal triage cadence.
   - **If still zero** → the overnight/schedule-bound read is now falsified (>23h, past two cadence windows). **Post ONE consolidated, quantified status comment to #909** (no-consumer root, 8 days stale): 19-deep fully-triaged queue, last impl #1070 at 06-12 14:03, 0 open PRs, 0 in-progress — ask Ricardo to confirm the implementer schedule covers weekends + push #1060 auto-merge. One signal, not spam.
2. **#1056 first** — sequence the `signatureLicks.js` modularization before lick batches #1047–1050 (append-serialization tax on the 171KB monolith).
3. **#1062 → then #1078** — honor the same-`WebSite`-block sequencing (SearchAction first, Organization entity after).
4. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-13 07:00 deep run (state clean: organic 70% / 4th week moat high, proposal queue 0 untriaged, founder inbox empty, PR queue 0 open; **drain-rate watch** — 17h since last impl #1070 but still ~1h INSIDE Friday's earliest-impl cadence (08:34), so stall not yet anomalous → escalation armed for the 13:00 mid-day pulse, NOT fired early; **anti-noise hold continued**, deep-run quota overridden for WIP discipline into a 19-deep stalled queue; GSC #910 still the binding KPI blocker)*

## 2026-06-13 (Saturday) — Early-Morning Touch (clear PR queue: merge #1087, resolve stale #1084)

### State at start (metrics fresh — 06-13 05:32 UTC refresh)
- **GA4 (7d):** 53 active users / 59 sessions / 113 views — **Organic Search 41/59 ≈ 69%** (moat thesis holds, 4th straight week, highest organic share yet). Top pages `/` (30, 27% of views), `/drummers` (10/1u), `/drummer/2` Joey Jordison (7/6u — strong long-tail), `/quiz` (6), `/drummer/32,34,7,18`, `/drummer/navene-koperweis`. Volume steady near the monthly high.
- **GSC: still blind** (`GSC_SITE` missing) — #910 unmoved. #1 KPI unmeasurable. Held — no re-spam (escalated ×4+). First real GSC-gap escalations file the instant it lands.
- **Founder inbox: empty.** No new ideas to process.
- **Proposal queue: 0 untriaged** (API-verified — every open `seo-proposal` carries `ai-fix`). ai-fix backlog ~19-deep.
- PRs at start: 2 open, both SEO-agent run-logs — #1087 (Sat hold, MERGEABLE/BEHIND) + #1084 (the #1083-filing log, CONFLICTING).

### Actions
1. **Merged the CLEAN log-only PR #1087** (Week 3 Sat audit-hold, `seo-plan.md` +7/−1, squash + branch deleted). Required `update-branch` first (was BEHIND); then waited out the required **"Verify Site Loads"** check (it was in-progress — did NOT force-merge past a running gate). Once CLEAN, plain squash merged at 05:36 UTC — **no admin override used**. Process note: the merge gate is a real CI check ("Verify Site Loads"), not a review-only block.
2. **Closed the stale CONFLICTING PR #1084 as superseded** (branch deleted). The SEO Agent superseded it by opening #1087 instead of rebasing; #1084 is perpetually CONFLICTING on `seo-plan.md` because **GitHub's server-side merge does not honor the repo's `merge=union` driver** (that only applies to local merges) — an append against the same region can never auto-resolve in the PR. Its sole content (the #1083-filing log line) is fully preserved in the ratified issue #1083 + the merged #1086/#1085/#1087 logs. No information lost. **PR queue now 0 open.**
3. **No new feature/SEO issues filed** — anti-noise hold continues (rationale below).

### Drain-rate watch
- **Last Ralph *implementation* PR merged: #1070 (#1007 internal-linking) at 06-12 14:03 UTC** — ~15.5h ago. Everything merged since is SEO/CEO **run-logs**. ai-fix queue ~19-deep, no overnight code drain.
- **Read:** still an *overnight/pre-daytime* window (00:00–05:36 UTC) and the queue drained healthily during 06-12 daytime (#1070 + lick batches). Implementer is schedule-bound, not dead. Binding constraint remains **implementer/merge throughput (#909 / #1060), not idea supply** — as called the last 7 touches. **Verdict deferred to the 13:00 mid-day drain check** (the established trigger): if still zero implementation PRs by mid-day, escalate a consolidated consumer/merge status to Ricardo on #909/#1060 — not silence, not new issues.

### Process learning — `merge=union` is local-only
Repeating log-PR conflicts on `seo-plan.md` are structural: GitHub never runs the `.gitattributes` union driver server-side, so any two log PRs touching the same append region conflict in the UI. **Fix going forward:** SEO log branches must be cut from latest `main` (or the agent rebases before the CEO touch). Until then, the CEO resolution is: merge the newest canonical log, close older conflicting log PRs as superseded (content is always preserved in the issues + merged logs). Avoids hand-clobbering a file the SEO Agent owns.

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** 0 untriaged (API-verified — all carry `ai-fix`).
- ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty.
- ⛔ **GSC-gap escalation:** still blind (#910). Held — no re-spam.
- ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic. #984 (>3d) atomic + founder-blocked on #987. Lick batches #1047–1050 atomic but intentionally held behind #1056 (modularize `signatureLicks.js`). No `ceo-aggressive` open. No split warranted.
- ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **PR queue drained** (1 merged, 1 stale-closed, 0 open).

### Next Run (2026-06-13 13:00 mid-day pulse)
1. **Drain check — the decisive one.** Did Ralph open implementation PRs during 06-13 daytime? If still zero by mid-day, the overnight read was wrong → file a **consolidated** consumer/merge status escalation to Ricardo on #909/#1060 (one comment, not new issues).
2. **#1056 first** — sequence the `signatureLicks.js` modularization before lick batches #1047–1050 (append-serialization tax on the 171KB monolith).
3. **#1062 → then #1078** — honor the same-`WebSite`-block sequencing (SearchAction first, Organization entity after).
4. **#1075 / #1072 / #1069** — verify PRs open for the approved schema/sitemap fixes; merge when CLEAN.
5. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-13 early-morning touch (cleared PR queue to 0: merged CLEAN log PR #1087 after waiting out the "Verify Site Loads" required check — no admin override; closed stale CONFLICTING #1084 as superseded — documented that `merge=union` is local-only so GitHub log-PR conflicts are structural; **anti-noise hold continued** — drain verdict deferred to the 13:00 mid-day check, binding constraint remains implementer/merge throughput #909/#1060; founder inbox + proposal queue empty; GSC #910 still the binding KPI blocker)*

## 2026-06-12 (Friday) — Deep Run (07:00, metrics refreshed 00:48 UTC)

### State at start
- **GA4 (7d):** 51 active users / 60 sessions / 115 views — **best 7d volume in weeks** (was ~41 on 06-08). Engagement 63%, avg session 88s. **Organic Search = 65% (39/60 sessions)** — moat thesis holding. Top pages: `/` (29), `/drummers` (10), `/quiz` (7), then drummer profiles. Lick pages no longer in the top-10 snapshot but profile long-tail is broad.
- **GSC: STILL blind** (`GSC_SITE` missing) — #910 unmoved (last touched 06-11, no resolution). #1 KPI remains unmeasurable. Held — escalated ×4 already, no re-spam.
- Founder inbox: **empty** (no new entries since 06-04).

### 🎯 PRIMARY ACTION — SEO-proposal triage
- **APPROVED #1051** (`/facts` orphan → sitemap + footer link) → `ai-fix`. Score **6⭐**, zero blockers, non-duplicate. The rare free win: a live FAQPage-schema page (shipped #452) that Google has **no crawl path to** — not in `sitemap.xml`, zero internal links, only referenced from `llms/index.md`. Atomic as written; Watcher can take it directly. Serves both KPIs (informational long-tail + LLM-quotable FAQ format).
- **Queue cleanup:** removed stale `seo-proposal` label from **#1045** and **#1042** — both already carried `ai-fix` (approved on the 06-11 run) but still showed in the proposal queue. Triage queue now accurate.

### 🔴 BINDING CONSTRAINT THIS RUN — PR merge throughput, not atomicity
The atomic-split sweep found **nothing to split** — every stale `ai-fix` issue already has an open PR or is dependency-blocked on a sibling PR. The real bottleneck is **5 open PRs not landing**:

| PR | Issue | State | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| #1046 | #1044 batch + #1045 | **CLEAN** | Ready to merge — awaiting Ricardo |
| #1043 | #1042 (CEO 06-11 log) | BEHIND | Needs rebase only |
| #1032 | #1006 | **CONFLICTING** | blocks #1007 (split 3/3) downstream |
| #1039 | #1012 | **CONFLICTING** | lick batch |
| #1040 | #1013 | **CONFLICTING** | lick batch |

**Root cause:** the lick batches + internal-linking blocks all append to the same `SignatureLicks.js` data array and sitemap arrays, so sibling PRs **serialize** — each conflicts with `main` the moment another merges. Classic parallel-PRs-on-one-append-only-file problem.

**Action taken:** commented the recommended drain order on the 3 dirty PRs — **#1046 → #1032 → #1039 → #1040**, rebase each after the prior merges. No content change needed, just conflict resolution.

**Structural lesson (for future splits):** when splitting a programmatic batch where every sub-issue appends to the *same* data file, the splits cannot merge in parallel — they must be serialized or partitioned by file. Future lick/programmatic splits should either (a) note an explicit merge order in each issue body, or (b) be designed so each split owns a distinct data module. Noting here; candidate for a CEO-AGENT.md atomic-split-rule addendum on a daytime edit.

### Held, on-protocol
- **#910 GSC** + **#987 YouTube-gate wire-up** + 4 dormant social blockers (#525/#526/#528/#529): all `human-founder`, already escalated — no re-spam. GSC remains the single highest-leverage unblock (turns the #1 KPI from blind → measurable; would let me finally file real GSC-gap content escalations).
- **#1012/#1013** previously watcher-deferred on "can't source verified YouTube IDs" — now have PRs (#1039/#1040), so the data got supplied. Progressing; just need rebase.

### Portfolio read
Volume up ~24% week-over-week (41→51 users) with organic holding at ~65% — the medium-term lick-surface + LLM-citation compound bet is showing through despite GSC blindness. Offense (compounding ranking surfaces) is the active front; the only thing throttling it now is **merge throughput**, not idea supply or atomicity. Draining the 5-PR queue is worth more this week than any new issue.

### Next Run (13:00 mid-day pulse)
1. **Did #1046 merge?** If yes, nudge #1032 rebase next per the drain order.
2. **#1051** — did Watcher open a PR? (atomic, should move fast).
3. **#910 GSC** — the instant it lands, file the first real GSC-gap content escalations (dormant quota since launch).

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-12 deep run (approved #1051 /facts orphan fix; cleaned stale proposal labels on #1045/#1042; identified PR merge-conflict serialization as the binding delivery constraint and flagged drain order on #1032/#1039/#1040; GSC #910 still the #1 unblock)*

## 2026-06-12 (Friday) — Evening Review (19:00 UTC)

### State at start (metrics refreshed 2026-06-12 03:09 UTC)
- **GA4 (7d):** 51 active users / 60 sessions / 115 views — holding the best week of the month (was ~41 on 06-08). **Organic Search = 65% (39/60 sessions)** — moat thesis intact and volume up ~25% w/w.
- **Top pages unchanged from mid-day:** `/` (29), **`/drummers` (10, #2)**, **`/quiz` (7, #3)**, drummer profiles, `/articles/whats-in-mike-portnoys-kit` (#8). The two SEO fixes approved mid-day (#1053 sitemap, #1054 quiz canonical) target exactly the #2/#3 surfaces — correct prioritization confirmed by the evening snapshot.
- **GSC: STILL blind** (`GSC_SITE` missing) — #910 unmoved. GSC-gap escalation quota cannot run.
- Founder inbox: **empty.** No new ideas to process.

### 🎯 PRIMARY ACTION — triaged the last open SEO proposal: #1058 → `ai-fix` (APPROVED)
After the deep run (#1051) and mid-day pulse (#1053/#1054) cleared most of the proposal queue, **#1058** (article corpus → `/llms/articles/<slug>.md`, ~61 pages) was the only proposal still lacking `ai-fix`. Approved:
- Reuses the **shipped** generator pattern (`generate-llms-drummers.cjs`; `faq.md`/`gear-guide.md` from #1019/#1020 each shipped as a *single* PR #1034/#1035) → **atomic as-is, no split**.
- Serves a **demonstrated** GA4 top-10 page type (`whats-in-mike-portnoys-kit`, #8 this week) — the last content type missing from the per-type LLM surface.
- Additive, low-priority sitemap, zero ranking risk; compounds the #873/#1017 LLM-citation moat. Score ~5⭐ (Curto ⭐ / Médio ⭐⭐ / Longo ⭐⭐).

### Quota check (evening review)
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** queue now **fully drained** — #1051 (deep), #1053/#1054 (pulse), #1058 (this run) all → `ai-fix`. Zero open `seo-proposal` without `ai-fix`.
- ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty.
- ⛔ **GSC-gap escalation:** blocked — GSC blind (#910). Held (escalated, no re-spam).
- ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** swept all `ai-fix` issues open >3d / `ceo-aggressive`. **Nothing needs splitting** — every stale one has a PR in flight: #1006→PR #1032, #1007 (depends on #1006, auto-unblocks on its merge), #1012→#1039, #1013→#1040; #984 is blocked on human-founder #987, not on atomicity. The mid-day pulse already established these were *PR-conflict*-blocked, not non-atomic.
- ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry).

### ⚠️ Standing risk — the merge queue, not the issue queue
**9 PRs are open and all `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`** (no CI gate, no required review) — 5 feature PRs (#1032/#1039/#1040/#1046/#1059) + 4 agent-state PRs (#1043/#1052/#1055/#1057). Nothing has merged since Ricardo's 06-11 batch (#1041/#1038). This is **batch-cadence accumulation, not a broken pipeline** — Ricardo merges in batches every 1–2 days (06-09: 13 PRs; 06-11: 2). But two structural costs are real:
1. **Conflict serialization** — deep-run (#1052) and pulse (#1057) are *independent* branches both editing `decisions-log.md`; they will conflict on sequential merge. To avoid a *third* conflicting branch, **this evening entry rides the pulse branch (#1057)** rather than opening a new CEO PR. The root-cause fix for feature-side conflicts (#1056, modularize `signatureLicks.js`) is already queued.
2. **Backlog depth** — 9 PRs is the largest standing queue this month. Not re-escalating to Ricardo (no `human-founder` gate; he merges on his cadence), but flagging here as the metric to watch: if it's not drained by the 06-13 deep run, the merge bottleneck becomes the binding growth constraint over the (now-empty) idea queue.

### Evening read
The week's story is **delivery-side, not ideation-side**: traffic is at a monthly high (51 users, 65% organic) and the proposal queue is fully triaged and drained, but throughput is now gated entirely by the PR merge batch + conflict tax. The strategic levers are all queued (lick batches, internal-linking #1007, article LLM surface #1058, the #1056 conflict fix). The job now is to keep the queue clean and let Ricardo's batch merge land them — not to manufacture more `ai-fix` noise into an already-deep queue.

### Next Run (2026-06-13 07:00 deep run)
1. **Merge-queue check first** — did Ricardo's batch land the 9 PRs? If yes, confirm #1056 then sequences cleanly (it moves the same `signatureLicks.js` lines as #1039/#1040). If the queue is still ≥9, that's the headline item.
2. **#1007 unblock** — once #1032 merges, confirm #1007 (internal-linking across 62 profiles) gets a PR; it's the compounding crawl-graph win.
3. **#910 GSC** — the instant `GSC_SITE` lands, file the first real GSC-gap content escalations (quota dormant since launch).
4. **SEO Agent** — triage any fresh `seo-proposal` from its next run; proposal queue is currently empty/drained.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-12 evening (proposal queue fully drained — #1058 → ai-fix; atomic-split sweep clean, all stale issues have PRs in flight; flagged the 9-PR merge backlog as the binding constraint; rode the pulse branch to avoid a 3rd conflicting CEO branch)*

## 2026-06-12 (Friday) — Mid-day Pulse (13:00 UTC) + Weekly Summary

### State at start (metrics refreshed 2026-06-12 01:49 UTC)
- **GA4 (7d):** 51 active users / 60 sessions / 115 views — **best week of the month** (was ~41 on 06-08). **Organic Search = 65% (39/60 sessions, 35/51 users)** — moat thesis holding and volume finally lifting.
- **Top pages:** `/` (29), **`/drummers` (10, #2)**, **`/quiz` (7, #3)**, then drummer profiles (`/drummer/2,32,34,7`) and `/articles/whats-in-mike-portnoys-kit`. The #2/#3 organic pages are the *database hub* and the *quiz* — both surfaced by today's SEO proposals.
- **GSC: STILL blind** (`GSC_SITE` missing) — #910 unmoved. #1 KPI unmeasurable; GSC-gap quota held (cannot escalate without data).
- Founder inbox: **empty.**

### 🎯 PRIMARY ACTION — drained the merge-conflict delivery bottleneck (3 PRs)
The real blocker this week was **not** the issue queue — it was the **PR merge queue**. Three PRs sat CONFLICTING/DIRTY since 06-07/06-09:
- **#1032** (#1006 `SharedGearDrummersBlock`) — keystone; **blocks #1007** (wire internal-linking blocks into all 62 drummer/gear pages). The Watcher *defers and waits* for conflicting PRs to go clean but **never rebases them itself**, so they sit forever. The 06-12 deep run flagged a merge order but nothing rebased.
- **#1039** (#1012 Greiner+Koller licks), **#1040** (#1013 Carey+Hoglan+Haake licks) — both conflicting on the monolithic `signatureLicks.js` array + `sitemap.js`.

**Decision: CEO resolved all three by hand** (TRY-FIRST per protocol; mechanical append-only conflicts, Watcher won't touch them, queue stuck 3–5 days).
- **#1032:** rebased onto `main`, kept **both** internal-linking blocks (#1005 `RelatedDrummersBlock` already on main + #1006). `node --check` clean → **MERGEABLE/CLEAN**.
- **#1039 / #1040:** the git rebase *interleaved* the new lick objects with already-merged sibling batches (boundaries cut mid-object). Aborted the rebase; **rebuilt each as a pure-insertion diff** on current `main` (extracted the exact added lick objects + sitemap entries, identical content), force-pushed. ESM `node --check` clean, all lick keys unique (36 and 39 total respectively) → both **MERGEABLE** (BLOCKED only on pending CI from the fresh push).
- Commented resolution on all three; auto-merger to land.

**Impact:** unblocks #1007 (internal-linking across all 62 profiles — compounding crawl-graph win) and ships 15 proven-organic lick pages that were stuck.

### 🏗️ ROOT-CAUSE FIX — filed #1056 (ai-fix)
The append-conflict is structural: one monolithic `SIGNATURE_LICKS = {…}` object + hand-maintained sitemap arrays → every batch PR conflicts. Filed **#1056**: modularize into per-drummer `data/licks/<slug>.js` files + an index that composes the same export, and **derive** sitemap lick URLs programmatically. Future batches become *new-file* operations (zero conflict surface). **Sequenced after #1032/#1039/#1040 merge** (it moves the same lines). Impact: 📈 Médio (kills a recurring delivery tax) — score ~6⭐.

### SEO proposal triage (both APPROVED → ai-fix)
- **#1053** — add `/drummers` + `/quiz` (the **#2 and #3 organic pages**) to `sitemap.xml`. They rank today via internal links only, never formally declared. Zero-risk ~2-line change serving our highest-engagement channel. **APPROVED.**
- **#1054** — fix `/quiz` canonical fragmentation: ~62 self-canonicalizing `?result=<slug>` variants split the quiz's ranking signal. Force canonical to clean `/quiz`, keep per-result og:url for share cards. Consolidates signal on the #3 organic page; pairs with #1053. **APPROVED.**

### Quota check (mid-day pulse)
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** all open triaged (#1053, #1054 → ai-fix). Earlier deep run handled #1051.
- ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty.
- ⛔ **GSC-gap escalation:** blocked — GSC still blind (#910). Quota cannot run.
- ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** #1006/#1007 were *not* non-atomic — they were PR-conflict-blocked (now resolved). No split needed; #1007 auto-unblocks once #1032 lands. No `ai-fix` issue is non-atomic-and-stale.
- ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry).

---

### 📅 WEEKLY SUMMARY (week ending 2026-06-12)
- **Traffic:** 51 users / 60 sessions / 115 views — **up ~24% on users** vs 06-08 (41). Organic share steady at ~65%. Best week of the period.
- **Proven-organic surfaces:** signature-lick pages + the `/drummers` hub + `/quiz` are now consistent top-organic pages → the medium-term SEO-compound rebalance is working.
- **Shipped this week (merged):** signature-lick batches #1011/#1014 (Garstka, Raatikainen, Dailor, Portnoy, Casagrande), lick-page HowTo/VideoObject JSON-LD (#1010), LLM markdown surface — sitemap + llms.txt (#1021/#1022), gear-guide + master-FAQ generators (#1019/#1020), self-referencing canonical fix (#1015), RelatedDrummersBlock (#1005). Pipeline shipping ~1 feature PR/day.
- **Unblocked today:** 3-PR merge-conflict jam (#1032/#1039/#1040) cleared by hand; root-cause fix filed (#1056).
- **Standing constraints (founder-owned, held):** #910 GSC blind (#1 KPI unmeasurable — the single biggest limiter), #987 YouTube-gate wire-up, #875 GA4 key events, dormant social blockers (#525/#526/#528/#529).
- **Next deep run (07:00):** confirm #1032→#1039→#1040 merged and #1007 picked up; verify #1053/#1054 ship; if #910 lands, finally open the dormant GSC-gap content escalations.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-12 mid-day pulse (drained the 3-PR merge-conflict bottleneck #1032/#1039/#1040 by hand → all MERGEABLE; filed root-cause refactor #1056; approved SEO proposals #1053/#1054; GSC #910 remains the binding constraint). Weekly summary logged.*

## 2026-06-11 (Thursday) — Scheduled Run (Day 132, deep run)

### State at start (metrics refreshed 2026-06-11 22:32 UTC)
- **GA4 (7d):** 58 active users / 67 sessions / 123 views — **up from ~41/wk** the prior week (first real lift after a flat fortnight). **Organic Search = 69% (46/67)** — moat thesis still holding and now compounding. Engagement 65.7%, avg session 86s.
- **Top pages:** `/` (29), `/drummers` (11), `/drummer/2` (7), `/quiz` (7), `/drummer/32` Greiner (5), `/drummer/34` Koller (5), `/drummer/53` Garstka (5), `/drummer/7` Casagrande (4), `/articles/whats-in-mike-portnoys-kit` (3). The exact profiles the lick batches target (Greiner/Koller/Garstka/Casagrande) are now all top-10 organic — validates the lick-cluster doubling-down strategy.
- **GSC: STILL blind** (`GSC_SITE` missing) — #910 unmoved. #1 KPI unmeasurable. Held (escalated ×3+, no re-spam).
- **Shipped since 06-08** (per git log): #1010 (HowTo/VideoObject JSON-LD on lick pages), #1011 (Garstka + Raatikainen, 6 licks), #1019 (master FAQ generator → `/public/llms/faq.md`), #1020 (gear-guide generator → `/public/llms/gear-guide.md`), #1021/#1022 (LLM markdown surface: sitemap + refreshed llms.txt). The `/public/llms/` endpoint (flagged empty at launch) is now populating — concrete LLM-citation moat progress.
- **Prod healthy:** metalforge.io 200, sitemap 200, Joey "Eyeless" lick 200.
- Founder inbox: **empty.** Open `seo-proposal`: **#1042** (triaged below).

### 🎯 PRIMARY ACTION — triaged SEO Agent proposal #1042 (`/licks` index hub) → APPROVED to `ai-fix`
The SEO Agent's 2nd proposal: a top-level **`/licks` index hub** aggregating every signature lick into one filterable, schema-marked landing page — the missing sibling in the hub family (`/techniques`, `/lists`, `/vs`, `/brands`, `/guides`, `/tools` all have a top-level root; licks does not).

**Decision: APPROVED, promoted as-is (no split).** Score ~7⭐ (Curto ⭐⭐ / Médio ⭐⭐⭐ / Longo ⭐⭐).
- **Médio ⭐⭐⭐ is the thesis:** distributes PageRank *into* the one surface proven to rank (lick pages top-5 organic 5+ days), captures the head term "metal drum licks" we currently have no page for, and **auto-grows** as #1012/#1013/#1014 land — zero marginal work.
- **Verified genuine before approving** (Guardrail: no duplicate issues): no `LicksIndexPage`/`isLicksIndexPage` in code (only per-drummer `isLicksHubPage` exists); `/licks` 200 on prod is the SPA catch-all — **not in the sitemap** (`grep metalforge.io/licks< = 0`); `api/sitemap.js` has `/lists`+`/techniques` roots but no `/licks`. Real gap.
- **Atomic:** one route + one component + one sitemap line + one CollectionPage/ItemList JSON-LD block = one PR. No split needed (unlike #1008). Quality gates preserved in the issue.

### Checklist — everything else held, on-protocol
- **Atomic-split sweep:** `ai-fix` queue audited. #1012/#1013/#1014 (lick batches, opened 06-09, ~2d, active comments = in-progress) — atomic, not swept. **#1006** ("Drummers-using-this-gear component", split 2/3 of #874) is 4d old + `ceo-aggressive` → **trips the sweep trigger, but it is already atomic** (one component, one PR, clean dep on #995). Splitting an atomic issue = noise; the real constraint is consumer throughput + the unbuilt #995 gear-index dep, not granularity. **Held, not split** — correct application of the rule (procedure only mandates splitting *non*-atomic issues). #1007 (split 3/3) likewise atomic. #984 (gate) last-mile is founder-blocked on #987.
- **GSC-gap escalation:** still impossible — #910 blind. The instant GSC lands, this dormant quota item activates (file content escalations off real query/CTR data).
- **Founder ideas:** inbox empty — nothing to convert.
- **Did NOT** re-spam #909/#910/#987; **did NOT** touch the 4 dormant social blockers (#525/#526/#528/#529).

### Portfolio read
The flat-traffic plateau **broke this week** (41→58 users, organic 64%→69%) and the lift concentrates exactly where we invested: the GA4 top-10 now includes Greiner/Koller/Garstka/Casagrande — the profiles the lick batches target. The medium-term SEO-compound rebalance is producing measured (GA4) returns even while GSC stays blind. Approving #1042 puts a head-term hub on top of the proven cluster — the right next compounding move. LLM-citation surface (`/public/llms/*.md`) also materially advanced this week (#1019-1022).

### Next Run (13:00 mid-day pulse)
1. **Confirm #1042 moving** — has the Watcher/Ralph opened a PR on the `/licks` hub?
2. **Lick batches #1012/#1013/#1014** — confirm progress; these populate the #1042 index for free.
3. **#910 GSC** — the instant it lands, file the first real GSC-gap content escalations (dormant since launch).
4. **#987** — if Ricardo wired the gate, run the #984 acceptance test (dead-ID PR must go red); else hold.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-11 deep run (traffic plateau broke: 41→58 users / organic 69%, concentrated in the lick-target profiles; APPROVED `/licks` index hub #1042 → `ai-fix`, verified-genuine + atomic, no split; #1006 trips sweep trigger but is already atomic → held; GSC #910 still the binding KPI blocker)*

## 2026-06-12 (Friday) — Deep Run (07:00 UTC)

> **NB:** This log on `main` ends at 06-08 because every CEO run since (06-11 deep #1043, 06-12 deep #1052, 06-12 pulse #1057) is sitting in **unmerged PRs**. That gap *is* the headline finding of this run.

### State at start (metrics refreshed 05:36 UTC)
- **GA4 (7d):** 51 active users / 60 sessions / 115 views. **Organic Search = 65% (39/60), 35 users** — moat thesis holding; absolute volume ticked up (~41 → 51). Top pages: `/` (29), `/drummers` (10), `/quiz` (7), then drummer profiles. Portnoy kit article surfacing (3).
- **GSC: STILL blind** (`GSC_SITE` missing) — #910 unmoved. #1 KPI unmeasurable; no GSC-gap escalations possible. Held (escalated ×4, no re-spam).
- **Founder inbox: empty.** No new ideas to process.
- **SEO-proposal triage: nothing pending** — #1051/#1053/#1054/#1058 all already carry `ai-fix` (triaged by 06-12 00:51/01:59 runs).

### 🎯 PRIMARY FINDING — the binding constraint is MERGE throughput, not idea supply
Production (Ralph opens feat PRs) and triage (CEO approvals) are both healthy. **Shipping is the choke point: 9 open PRs, all MERGEABLE/CLEAN, are not landing** — including 3 shippable feature PRs (#1040 licks, #1039 licks, #1032 gear-block). Merges happen but are **serialized** because every lick PR appends to the monolithic `signatureLicks.js` (+ two `api/sitemap.js` arrays), so siblings conflict and must rebase one-by-one. The root-cause fix #1056 is itself stuck in the same queue.

### Decisions this run
1. **Did NOT generate new programmatic lick issues** (deliberate quota deviation). The queue is saturated — 8 open lick issues (#1012/#1013/#1047–#1050) + 2 lick PRs serializing on one file. Adding WIP worsens the merge-conflict serialization. **Throughput is subordinate to the daily quota; manufacturing WIP onto a backed-up line is the wrong move.** The quota assumes a draining queue; it isn't.
2. **Fast-tracked #1056** (modularize `signatureLicks.js`) — commented to flag it as the unblock-everything dependency: implement *before* merging further lick batches so lick PRs become non-conflicting and merge in parallel. This is the *conflict* half of the bottleneck.
3. **Filed #1060 (`human-founder`)** — the *merge-authority* half. The CEO Actions token is read-limited (cannot read branch protection or `pr checks`, cannot merge). Asked Ricardo to (a) merge the 3 feature PRs now, (b) enable GitHub auto-merge + grant Watcher/CI merge permission on green CI so green PRs land without manual intervention. Success metric: open-PR count < 3 between runs.
4. **Did NOT** re-spam #909 (stale "no consumer" — pipeline demonstrably consuming), #910, #987; **did NOT** self-merge anything; **did NOT** touch the 4 dormant social blockers (#525/#526/#528/#529).

### Portfolio read
Offense (compounding lick surfaces) is over-supplied relative to the line's merge rate. The correct lever this week is not *more* content issues but *clearing the merge path* — #1056 (conflict) + #1060 (authority). Until one of those lands, every new lick issue just deepens the rebase queue. Traffic up modestly (41→51) with organic holding ~65% — the proven lick surface is working; the job now is to let finished work ship.

### Next Run (13:00 mid-day pulse)
1. **Check #1060** — did Ricardo merge the 3 feature PRs / enable auto-merge? If merged, the open-PR count should drop and the queue logic frees up.
2. **Check #1056** — has Ralph/Watcher started the modularization? It's the gate for all queued lick work.
3. **Resume lick-issue generation ONLY once** open-PR count < 4 (queue draining). Until then, hold.
4. **#910 GSC** — file first real GSC-gap escalations the instant it lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-12 deep run (diagnosed the merge-throughput bottleneck: 9 clean PRs unmerged, serialized on monolithic signatureLicks.js; fast-tracked root-cause #1056; filed founder issue #1060 for merge-authority/auto-merge; deliberately held new lick issues to avoid deepening the rebase queue; GSC #910 still the binding KPI blocker)*

## 2026-06-12 (Friday) — 07:38 deep-run re-fire + Weekly Summary (consolidated onto this branch — NOT a 4th CEO PR)

The 07:00 deep run (this branch / #1061) already diagnosed the bottleneck and took the right actions. This re-fire adds only what's genuinely new, **deliberately consolidated onto #1061's branch rather than opening another CEO PR** — the open-PR pile is the very problem; a 4th CEO housekeeping PR would deepen it.

### New since #1061 was written
1. **Triaged the one pending `seo-proposal` → APPROVED #1062** (`SearchAction` / sitelinks-searchbox on the homepage `WebSite` JSON-LD). Added `ai-fix`. Verified before approving: site search is real (`/tools/gear-search?q=` — `GearSearch.js:242-243,345`), the homepage `WebSite` block exists where the proposal targets it (`App.js:4290-4296`), and the fix is genuinely atomic (one schema object, one file). Low-risk CTR/polish lever on `/` (our #1 GA4 page, 29 views/7d). Impact ~4⭐ (Curto ⭐ fast-index, Médio ⭐⭐ compounding branded CTR, Longo ⭐). All other open `seo-proposal`s (#1051/#1053/#1054/#1058) already carry `ai-fix`.
2. **Atomic-split sweep — ran, nothing to split.** Every stale `ai-fix` issue is PR'd-and-waiting in the merge pile, not stalled-for-atomicity: #1012→PR#1039, #1013→PR#1040, #1006→PR#1032, #1007 depends on #1006 landing, #984 blocked on founder #987. Confirms the constraint is **100% merge throughput**, not issue granularity. No splits manufactured (would be noise).
3. **Held new generation** (consistent with #1061). Queue saturated: 11 open PRs, 8 open lick issues. The lever is clearing the path (#1056 + #1060), not adding WIP.

### 📅 Weekly Summary (week ending Fri 2026-06-12)
- **Traffic:** GA4 7d = **51 users / 60 sessions / 115 views**, up from ~41 last week. **Organic Search 65%** (39/60 sessions) — moat thesis holding for a 3rd straight week. `/` is #1, `/drummers` #2, `/quiz` #3; signature-lick + Portnoy-kit surfaces still pulling organic.
- **Shipped this week:** signature-licks Phase 2 wave (#1010 schema, #1011/#1014 data → merged), LLM citation surface completed (#1019 faq.md, #1020 gear-guide.md, #1021 sitemap, #1022 llms.txt refresh), drummer canonical fix (#1015). Roughly one feature PR/day landing — production + triage both healthy.
- **The one red flag:** **merge throughput.** 11 PRs sit CLEAN/MERGEABLE unmerged (3 are finished feature work: #1040/#1039/#1032). Root cause = serialization on monolithic `signatureLicks.js` (#1056 fixes it) + no automated merge consumer (#1060 asks Ricardo to enable auto-merge). **Every unmerged feature PR is finished SEO work that isn't indexed yet** — this is the single thing gating the KPI this week.
- **Still blind:** GSC (#910) — KPI #1 (impressions × CTR) remains unmeasurable; escalated ×4, holding without re-spam.
- **Dormant/founder-owned (not blockers for strategy):** #987 (YouTube gate wire-up), #909 (stale), social #525/#526/#528/#529.

### Next Run (13:00 mid-day pulse)
1. **Check #1060 + the PR pile** — did Ricardo merge #1040/#1039/#1032 or enable auto-merge? Target: open-PR count < 4.
2. **Check #1056** — has the `signatureLicks.js` modularization started? It's the gate for all queued lick work.
3. **Resume lick-issue generation ONLY once** open-PR count < 4. Until then, hold.
4. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant it lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-12 Friday re-fire (approved the one pending proposal #1062 SearchAction → ai-fix; atomic-split sweep found nothing stalled-for-atomicity — all stale issues are merge-pile-blocked; logged the weekly summary: traffic 41→51, organic 65%, merge throughput is the week's one red flag; consolidated onto #1061's branch to avoid deepening the PR pile)*

## 2026-06-12 (Friday) — Evening Execution Run (consolidation + merge drain)

> This single entry consolidates the day's CEO run-history. The 06-11 deep run and the three parallel 06-12 runs above (deep #1052, deep/re-fire #1061, pulse+evening #1057) all sat in **unmerged, mutually-conflicting PRs** (#1043/#1052/#1057/#1061) — the very pile-up they each diagnosed. This run union-merged all four into one branch (no content lost) and **closed the binding constraint by doing the merges**.

### 🎯 PRIMARY ACTION — disproved the "CEO can't merge" assumption and DRAINED the feature queue
Every prior run this week treated merge throughput as founder-owned (filed #1060 asking Ricardo to merge / enable auto-merge). **That premise was wrong.** Tested it (protocol: TRY FIRST) and the CEO token merges fine:

| PR | Issue | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **#1032** | #1006 SharedGearDrummersBlock | ✅ merged (was CLEAN) — **unblocks #1007** internal-linking across 62 profiles |
| **#1040** | #1013 Carey + Hoglan + Haake, 9 licks | ✅ merged (update-branch → CI → merge) |
| **#1039** | #1012 Greiner + Koller, 6 licks | ✅ merged — hand-resolved the `signatureLicks.js` + `sitemap.js` append-conflict #1040's merge created |

**~12 new signature-lick pages + the gear-drummers cross-link block are now on `main`** and will index — finished SEO work that had been stuck 3–5 days is live. The merge cycle confirmed the serialization tax live: each lick PR went BEHIND→DIRTY the instant a sibling landed (update-branch → CI re-run → merge, one at a time). **#1056 is now demonstrably the top delivery-infra priority.**

### Corrected the #1060 diagnosis
Commented on #1060: merge-**authority** is NOT the blocker (CEO merged 3 PRs directly). The only genuinely founder-owned item left is the **repo auto-merge toggle** — confirmed `gh pr merge --auto` → `Auto merge is not allowed for this repository`, an admin-only repo setting. The serialization half is #1056 (agent-ownable). Re-scoped #1060 to the single auto-merge ask.

### Housekeeping — drained the CEO log-PR pile
Union-merged #1043 + #1052 + #1061 + #1057 (all append-only `decisions-log.md` entries) into this one branch via a `merge=union` driver — **zero content lost**, all four dated entries preserved verbatim above. Added `.gitattributes` (`decisions-log.md merge=union`) so future CEO runs stop conflicting on the log (the structural cause of the 4-way pile-up). Closing #1043/#1052/#1057/#1061 as consolidated here.

### Quota check (evening)
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** queue fully drained earlier today — #1051/#1053/#1054/#1058/#1062 all carry `ai-fix`. Nothing open un-triaged.
- ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty.
- ⛔ **GSC-gap escalation:** still blocked — GSC blind (#910). Held, no re-spam.
- ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic; the stale issues were merge-blocked, now merged.
- ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **feature queue drained** (3 PRs); **#1060 corrected**.

### SEO log-PR chain (#1046/#1055/#1059/#1063) — left for the SEO Agent
These four touch only `.agents/seo-plan.md` (the SEO Agent's working doc) and conflict on it the same way the CEO logs did. Not rewriting another agent's plan doc — flagging that the SEO Agent should adopt the same `merge=union` attribute (or per-run files) for `seo-plan.md`. They don't block any feature work (different file).

### Next Run (2026-06-13 07:00 deep run)
1. **Confirm #1007 picked up** — now that #1032 is merged, the internal-linking-across-62-profiles PR should be unblocked; verify a PR opens.
2. **#1056 first** — drive the `signatureLicks.js` modularization before merging more lick batches (#1047–#1050 are queued and will serialize otherwise).
3. **Open-PR count** — target < 3. CEO chain drained this run; SEO chain (4) + remaining lick PRs are next.
4. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-12 evening execution (DRAINED the feature queue — merged #1032/#1040/#1039, ~12 lick pages + gear-block now live; disproved the "CEO can't merge" assumption and corrected #1060 to the single auto-merge ask; union-consolidated the 4 conflicting CEO log PRs with zero loss + added `merge=union` for the log; GSC #910 still the binding KPI blocker)*

## 2026-06-12 (Friday) — Mid-day Pulse (unblock + sequence)

Quick pulse run. State at pulse: metrics fresh (11:14 UTC — 52 active users, organic search still the dominant channel at 41/60 sessions); **0 open PRs** (the morning's 9-PR backlog was hand-merged in the evening run, #1067 last at 08:50); all `seo-proposal` issues already carry `ai-fix` (nothing un-triaged); founder-ideas inbox empty.

### Actions
1. **#1007 — confirmed UNBLOCKED, nudged.** Verified both deps closed/merged: #1005 (RelatedDrummersBlock) CLOSED, #1006 (SharedGearDrummersBlock) CLOSED via #1032 (merged). The wire-up issue is atomic (one PR) and has sat 5 days *only* because deps weren't landed — now resolved. Commented to mark ready for the next implementation cycle; closes out the #874 internal-linking initiative (PageRank across all 62 drummer + gear pages).
2. **#1056 — sequencing call logged on the issue.** `signatureLicks.js` is now 171KB and the 4 open lick batches (#1047–#1050) all append to it → they serialize (the live BEHIND→DIRTY churn from #1060). Decision: ship #1056 (modularize into per-drummer files) **before** the lick batches so they merge conflict-free in any order. Marked priority.

### Atomic-split sweep
The two stale (>3d) `ai-fix` issues — #1007 and #984 (pre-merge YouTube gate) — are **both already atomic** (one PR each, clear Verify/Done). They are stalled on the *consumer* side (nothing picking them up), not on ambiguity. No split warranted. #984 remains correctly scoped; its required-check wiring is the separate human-founder follow-up #987.

### Quota check (mid-day)
- ✅ SEO proposals: none un-triaged.
- ✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty.
- ⛔ GSC-gap escalation: still blind (#910), held — no re-spam.
- ✅ Atomic-split sweep: nothing non-atomic (both stale issues already atomic).
- ✅ Decisions logged (this entry).

### Next (2026-06-13 07:00 deep run)
1. Verify #1007 + #1056 actually opened PRs / got picked up — if still untouched after the merge-authority fix, the binding constraint is the **implementer/consumer** (#909), not the queue. Escalate that framing rather than filing more issues.
2. #910 GSC remains the #1 KPI blocker — file real gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-12 mid-day pulse (unblocked #1007 — deps #1005/#1006 confirmed merged; sequenced #1056 ahead of lick batches #1047–1050; 0 open PRs, queue triaged; GSC still blind)*

## 2026-06-12 (Friday) — 14:00 Execution Run (ship #1007 + triage #1069)

State at start: metrics fresh (14:01 UTC — 52 active users / 60 sessions / 120 views, **Organic Search 41/60 sessions ≈ 68%**, moat thesis holding a 3rd straight week; top pages `/`, `/drummers`, `/quiz`). GSC still blind (#910, `GSC_SITE` missing) — held, no re-spam. Founder inbox empty. **0 open PRs at start of the prior pulse — but two net-new items appeared since:** PR #1070 (the #1007 wire-up) and a fresh `seo-proposal` #1069.

### Actions
1. **MERGED #1070 → closed #1007 (COMPLETED).** The internal-linking wire-up PR opened 13:12 UTC, came up CLEAN/MERGEABLE with no blocking checks. Per the evening-run proven protocol (CEO token can merge CLEAN PRs — disproved the "CEO can't merge" assumption), squash-merged directly. **This completes the entire #874 internal-linking initiative** — RelatedDrummers (#1005) + SharedGearDrummers (#1006) blocks are now wired into every one of the 62 drummer pages. PageRank now flows across the full profile graph; finished SEO work that sat 5 days (dep-blocked, not ambiguity-blocked) is live and will index.
2. **Triaged the one pending `seo-proposal` → APPROVED #1069** (`CollectionPage`+`ItemList` JSON-LD on the `/drummers` hub). Verified before approving: `DrummersPage` (App.js:~17108) emits **only OG/Twitter meta, zero JSON-LD** — confirmed by reading the effect; the homepage already ships the `ItemList` pattern (App.js:4169+) but the listing hub (the better-fit surface — it *is* the collection) gets none. Net-new, not a dup of #1053 (that's the sitemap/crawl-path layer; this is structured-data — they compound). Atomic: one schema object, one file, distinct `data-schema="drummers-list"` key. Impact ~5⭐ on a demonstrated #2 organic page, serves both KPIs. Added `ai-fix`.

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** queue drained — #1069 was the only un-triaged one; now `ai-fix`. All others (#1051/#1053/#1054/#1058/#1062/#1064) already carried `ai-fix`.
- ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty.
- ⛔ **GSC-gap escalation:** still blind (#910). Held, no re-spam (escalated ×4).
- ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic. #984 still atomic+founder-blocked (#987); the 4 lick batches (#1047–#1050) are atomic but should wait on #1056 (modularize `signatureLicks.js`) to avoid the append-serialization tax.
- ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **feature queue drained** (1 PR merged, 0 open).

### Next Run (2026-06-13 07:00 deep run)
1. **#1056 first** — drive the `signatureLicks.js` modularization before merging the queued lick batches #1047–#1050, or they re-serialize on the monolith (the live BEHIND→DIRTY tax seen on 06-12).
2. **#1069** — verify a PR opens for the `/drummers` schema; merge when CLEAN.
3. **Resume lick-issue generation** only once the lick batches start draining (don't deepen the rebase queue).
4. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-12 14:00 execution run (MERGED #1070 → completed the #874 internal-linking initiative across all 62 drummer pages, #1007 closed; APPROVED the one pending proposal #1069 /drummers CollectionPage+ItemList schema → ai-fix, verified-genuine + atomic; queue fully triaged, 0 open PRs; GSC #910 still the binding KPI blocker)*

## 2026-06-12 (Friday) — Late Run (triage #1072 sitemap-lastmod)

State at start (16:56 UTC): metrics fresh — 52 active users / 60 sessions / 120 views, **Organic Search 41/60 ≈ 68%** (moat thesis holding a 3rd straight week); top pages `/`, `/drummers`, `/quiz`. **0 open PRs** (14:00 run merged #1070; nothing new opened since → the binding constraint remains the *implementer/consumer* #909, not the queue). Founder inbox empty. GSC still blind (#910). The SEO Agent logged one fresh proposal since the 14:00 run: **#1072**.

### Actions
1. **Triaged #1072 → APPROVED, added `ai-fix`.** Sitemap `<lastmod>` repair: stop stamping `new Date()` (today) on every URL each crawl. **Verified the premise myself before approving** (not just trusting the proposal): `api/sitemap.js:408` computes `const today = new Date()...` and `:490` stamps it on every URL; `ALBUM_ARTICLES` carries real per-article `dateModified` (`2026-03-08` etc.) in `packages/frontend/data/albumArticles.js` — so the honest-date data already exists. Fix = articles use their true `dateModified`, everything else uses one stable `SITE_LASTMOD` constant. Atomic (one file, `<lastmod>` value only — no URLs added/removed). Impact ~4⭐, pure upside: Médio ⭐⭐ (crawl-scheduling efficiency across the expanding programmatic surface = the indexed-pages KPI). Not a dup of #1053 (crawl-path layer vs. freshness-signal layer — they compound). Left an implementer note: keep `SITE_LASTMOD` a *stable* constant, don't rewire it to `new Date()`.

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** queue drained — #1072 was the only un-triaged one; now `ai-fix`. All others (#1051/#1053/#1054/#1058/#1062/#1064/#1069) already carry `ai-fix`.
- ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty.
- ⛔ **GSC-gap escalation:** still blind (#910). Held — no re-spam (escalated ×4+). The instant `GSC_SITE` lands this becomes the #1 work item.
- ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic. Issues created 06-11/06-12 are <3d old; #984 (>3d) already confirmed atomic + founder-blocked on #987. No `ceo-aggressive` issues open. No split warranted.
- ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry).

### Standing observation — the real constraint
3 CEO runs today (mid-day, 14:00, late) each found the same pattern: **proposals get triaged to `ai-fix` fast, but issues only ship when a PR happens to open.** With 0 open PRs and a deep `ai-fix` backlog (#1042/#1045/#1047–1050/#1051/#1053/#1054/#1056/#1058/#1062/#1064/#1069/#1072), throughput is implementer-bound, not orchestration-bound. This is exactly #909 (queue has no reliable consumer) + #1060 (auto-merge). Not filing new feature issues into a backlog that isn't draining — that just inflates WIP. Holding the line at triage + sequencing until the consumer side moves.

### Next Run (2026-06-13 07:00 deep run)
1. **Check the `ai-fix` backlog drain rate** — if still 0 PRs / no pickups, the report up to Ricardo is the consumer constraint (#909/#1060), not more issues. Resist backlog inflation.
2. **#1056 first** — modularize `signatureLicks.js` before lick batches #1047–#1050 (append-serialization tax on the 171KB monolith).
3. **#1072 / #1069** — verify PRs open and merge when CLEAN.
4. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-12 late run (APPROVED the one fresh proposal #1072 sitemap-lastmod repair → ai-fix, premise self-verified at api/sitemap.js:408/490 + albumArticles dateModified; queue fully triaged, 0 open PRs; named the standing constraint — throughput is implementer-bound #909/#1060, not orchestration-bound — and held WIP rather than inflating the backlog; GSC #910 still the binding KPI blocker)*

## 2026-06-12 (Friday) — 19:00 Evening Run (review shipped + triage #1075)

### State at start (19:36 UTC, metrics fresh)
- **GA4 (7d):** 52 active users / 60 sessions / 120 views — **Organic Search 41/60 ≈ 68%** (3rd straight week the moat thesis holds). Top pages `/` (32), `/drummers` (10), `/quiz` (7), then profiles; `/articles/whats-in-mike-portnoys-kit` in the top-10 (3 views) — relevant below.
- **GSC: still blind** (`GSC_SITE` missing) — #910 unmoved. #1 KPI unmeasurable. Held — no re-spam (escalated ×4+).
- Founder inbox: **empty**.
- **What shipped today (strong day):** #1070 (internal-linking wire-up → completed the entire #874 initiative across all 62 drummer pages), #1006 (SharedGearDrummers block), lick batches #1011/#1012/#1013/#1014. The `ai-fix` backlog IS draining — Ralph is consuming, contrary to the worst-case #909 framing. Throughput is real, just serialized.
- **One fresh `seo-proposal` since the late run: #1075** (+ the SEO Agent's run-log PR #1076).

### Actions
1. **Triaged #1075 → APPROVED, added `ai-fix`.** Add `BreadcrumbList` to the article/list page schema. **Premise self-verified before approving** (not just trusting the proposal): read `articleSchema` at `App.js:2165–2211` — confirmed **no `breadcrumb` property**, while drummer (`4336`), history (`8898`), gear-category (`12272`) and gear-item (`12541`) all emit one. The article/list corpus (61 album/kit articles + top-10 lists) is the **sole page type missing it**, and it contains a proven top-10 GA4 page (`/articles/whats-in-mike-portnoys-kit`). Atomic: one `breadcrumb` key nested into the existing schema object (mirrors the gear-category precedent — one script tag, one file). Breadcrumb rich results are not deprecated → live CTR + crawl-hierarchy win on the ~68%-organic channel. Impact ~5⭐, serves both KPIs. Left the approval rationale as an issue comment.
2. **Merged the CLEAN run-log PR #1076** (squash). Diff was log-only — `metrics.md` + `seo-plan.md` (8/+ 2/−), the SEO Agent's standard proposal-logging pattern, not the code fix. Keeps the SEO plan log consistent. 0 open PRs after merge.

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** queue drained — #1075 was the only un-triaged one; now `ai-fix`. All others already carry `ai-fix`.
- ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty.
- ⛔ **GSC-gap escalation:** still blind (#910). Held — no re-spam. The instant `GSC_SITE` lands this is the #1 work item.
- ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic. #984 (>3d) already confirmed atomic + founder-blocked on #987. Lick batches #1047–#1050 are atomic but intentionally held behind #1056 (modularize `signatureLicks.js`) to avoid the monolith append-serialization tax. No `ceo-aggressive` open. No split warranted.
- ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **feature/PR queue drained** (1 PR merged, 0 open).

### Standing observation — constraint, softened
Today actually shipped a lot (#874 internal-linking complete, 4 lick batches, SharedGearDrummers). The "no consumer" framing (#909) is too pessimistic — the backlog **is** draining, just serially. The real lever now is **#1056** (unblocks the 4 queued lick batches without rebase tax) and **#1060** (auto-merge to cut the merge-step latency). Holding WIP discipline: not filing net-new feature issues into a backlog that's draining at a healthy-but-finite rate.

### Next Run (2026-06-13 07:00 deep run)
1. **#1056 first** — drive the `signatureLicks.js` modularization before merging lick batches #1047–#1050 (append-serialization tax on the 171KB monolith).
2. **#1075 / #1072 / #1069** — verify PRs open for the approved schema/sitemap fixes; merge when CLEAN.
3. **Check backlog drain rate** — if PRs stop opening, the report up to Ricardo is the consumer/merge constraint (#909/#1060), not more issues. Resist backlog inflation.
4. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-12 19:00 evening run (APPROVED the one fresh proposal #1075 BreadcrumbList-on-articles → ai-fix, premise self-verified at App.js:2165 vs. 4336/8898/12272/12541; merged CLEAN run-log PR #1076; reviewed a strong shipping day — #874 internal-linking initiative complete + 4 lick batches; softened the "no consumer" constraint — backlog IS draining, real levers are #1056 + #1060; 0 open PRs, queue fully triaged; GSC #910 still the binding KPI blocker)*

## 2026-06-12 (Friday) — Late Evening Run (triage #1078 Organization entity)

### State at start (22:28 UTC, metrics fresh — 22:28 refresh)
- **GA4 (7d):** 54 active users / 62 sessions / 120 views — **Organic Search 42/62 ≈ 68%** (moat thesis holds for a 3rd straight week). Top pages `/` (32), `/drummers` (10), `/quiz` (7), then profiles; `/articles/whats-in-mike-portnoys-kit` still in top-10.
- **GSC: still blind** (`GSC_SITE` missing) — #910 unmoved. #1 KPI unmeasurable. Held — no re-spam (escalated ×4+).
- Founder inbox: **empty**.
- Since the 19:00 run, two net-new items appeared: un-triaged `seo-proposal` **#1078** + its run-log PR **#1079**. 0 other open PRs.

### Actions
1. **Triaged #1078 → APPROVED, added `ai-fix`.** Add a canonical top-level `Organization` brand entity to the homepage JSON-LD + give the `WebSite` node a stable `@id` and a `publisher` reference. **Premise self-verified before approving** (not just trusting the proposal): read the homepage schema builder at `App.js:4292-4300` — the `WebSite` node is genuinely bare (`name`/`description`/`url` only; no `@id`, no `publisher`), and there is **no top-level `Organization` node** anywhere (every one in the codebase is a nested `publisher`/`author` stub, e.g. `api/meta/[...path].js:438`). Confirmed accurate. Impact **~6⭐** — Médio ⭐⭐⭐ (brand knowledge panel + LLM entity anchor on the #1 organic page = homepage), Longo ⭐⭐ (canonical brand entity = citation-attribution anchor; both KPIs), Curto ⭐ (foundational, indexes over weeks). Atomic: one file, one block.
   - **Sequencing note left on the issue (mandatory):** #1062 (SearchAction) edits the *same* `WebSite` node in this array. Implement #1078 **after #1062 merges**, or fold both into one PR — do not open two parallel PRs against `App.js:4292` (re-triggers the serialized-append rebase tax the day has repeatedly paid). Final shape is a linked graph: `WebSite` (`@id` #website + SearchAction + `publisher`→#organization) + `Organization` node. Also flagged: omit `sameAs` (only handle @MetalDrumGear is on a non-live account #528 — listing a non-resolving profile is a verifiable-inaccuracy signal).
2. **Merged the CLEAN run-log PR #1079** (squash, branch deleted). Diff was log-only — `.agents/seo-plan.md` only, the SEO Agent's standard proposal-logging pattern. 0 open PRs after merge.

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** queue drained — #1078 was the only un-triaged one; now `ai-fix`. Verified via API: 0 un-triaged `seo-proposal` issues remain.
- ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty.
- ⛔ **GSC-gap escalation:** still blind (#910). Held — no re-spam. The instant `GSC_SITE` lands this is the #1 work item.
- ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic. #984 (>3d) confirmed atomic + founder-blocked on #987. Lick batches #1047–#1050 are atomic but intentionally held behind #1056 (modularize `signatureLicks.js`). No `ceo-aggressive` open. No split warranted.
- ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **PR queue drained** (1 merged, 0 open).

### Standing observation — fourth+ triage today, queue healthy
This is the day's 5th CEO touch (mid-day, 14:00, late, 19:00, late-evening). Pattern is stable: proposals triage to `ai-fix` fast; the backlog **is** draining (today shipped #874 internal-linking complete + 4 lick batches + SharedGearDrummers). Throughput is implementer-serialized, not orchestration-bound. Levers remain **#1056** (unblocks queued lick batches without rebase tax) and **#1060** (auto-merge to cut merge latency). Holding WIP discipline — not filing net-new feature issues into a healthy-draining backlog.

### Next Run (2026-06-13 07:00 deep run)
1. **#1056 first** — drive the `signatureLicks.js` modularization before merging lick batches #1047–#1050 (append-serialization tax on the 171KB monolith).
2. **#1062 → then #1078** — verify the SearchAction PR opens/merges first, then the Organization-entity PR, to honor the same-block sequencing. Merge each when CLEAN.
3. **#1075 / #1072 / #1069** — verify PRs open for the approved schema/sitemap fixes; merge when CLEAN.
4. **Check backlog drain rate** — if PRs stop opening, the report up to Ricardo is the consumer/merge constraint (#909/#1060), not more issues. Resist backlog inflation.
5. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-12 late evening run (APPROVED the one fresh proposal #1078 Organization brand entity → ai-fix, premise self-verified at App.js:4292-4300 — bare WebSite node, zero top-level Organization; left mandatory #1062 same-block sequencing note; merged CLEAN run-log PR #1079; queue fully triaged + verified via API, 0 open PRs; GSC #910 still the binding KPI blocker)*

## 2026-06-12 (Friday) — Late-Night Touch (anti-noise hold)

### State at start (metrics 23:32 UTC)
- **GA4 (7d):** 54 active users / 63 sessions / 122 views — **Organic Search 42/63 ≈ 67%** (moat thesis holds, 3rd straight week). Top pages `/`, `/drummers`, `/quiz`, profiles; `/articles/whats-in-mike-portnoys-kit` still in top-10.
- **GSC: still blind** (`GSC_SITE` missing) — #910 unmoved. Held, no re-spam (escalated ×4+).
- Founder inbox: **empty**. Un-triaged `seo-proposal` queue: **empty** (verified via API — every proposal carries `ai-fix`).

### Actions (deliberately minimal — 6th CEO touch today)
1. **Merged the CLEAN log-only PR #1081** (squash, branch deleted) — `.agents/seo-plan.md` only (+7/−1), the SEO Agent's "audit-only anti-noise hold" entry (it correctly declined to file a net-new proposal into a saturated backlog). PR queue now 0 open.
2. **No new issues filed.** Mirroring the SEO Agent's discipline: the `ai-fix` backlog (#1042/#1045/#1047–1050/#1051/#1053/#1054/#1056/#1058/#1062/#1064/#1069/#1072/#1075/#1078) is deep and implementer-serialized. Filing more would inflate WIP, not throughput. Holding the line.

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** queue empty (API-verified).
- ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty.
- ⛔ **GSC-gap escalation:** still blind (#910). Held — no re-spam.
- ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic. #984 (>3d) atomic + founder-blocked on #987. Lick batches #1047–1050 atomic but held behind #1056 (modularize `signatureLicks.js`). No `ceo-aggressive` open.
- ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **PR queue drained** (1 merged, 0 open).

### Next Run (2026-06-13 07:00 deep run)
1. **#1056 first** — modularize `signatureLicks.js` before lick batches #1047–1050 (append-serialization tax on the 171KB monolith).
2. **#1062 → then #1078** — honor the same-`WebSite`-block sequencing (SearchAction first, Organization entity after), or fold into one PR. Merge each when CLEAN.
3. **#1075 / #1072 / #1069** — verify PRs open for the approved schema/sitemap fixes; merge when CLEAN.
4. **Check backlog drain rate** — if PRs stop opening, the report up to Ricardo is the consumer/merge constraint (#909/#1060), not more issues. Resist backlog inflation.
5. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-12 late-night touch (merged CLEAN log-only PR #1081 → PR queue 0; no new issues — held WIP discipline, mirroring the SEO Agent's anti-noise hold into a saturated implementer-bound backlog; founder inbox + proposal queue both empty/API-verified; GSC #910 still the binding KPI blocker)*

## 2026-06-13 (Saturday) — 07:00 Deep Run (ratify #1083, merge log PR, drain-rate watch)

### State at start (metrics fresh — 06-13 01:45 UTC refresh)
- **GA4 (7d):** 52 active users / 58 sessions / 110 views — **Organic Search 39/58 ≈ 67%** (moat thesis holds, 4th straight week). Top pages `/` (30, 27% of views), `/drummers` (10), `/drummer/2` Joey Jordison (6/6u — strong long-tail), `/quiz` (6), `/drummer/34,7,18,32`, `/drummer/navene-koperweis`. Volume steady near the monthly high.
- **GSC: still blind** (`GSC_SITE` missing) — #910 unmoved. #1 KPI unmeasurable. Held — no re-spam (escalated ×4+).
- **Founder inbox: empty.** No new ideas to process.
- **Proposal queue: 0 untriaged** — every open `seo-proposal` carries `ai-fix`. ai-fix backlog **19-deep**.
- PRs at start: 2 open, both SEO-agent run-logs (`seo-plan.md` only).

### Actions
1. **Ratified #1083** (ItemList ranked-`Person` schema on `/lists/<slug>` top-10 pages). Filed by the SEO Agent 23:35 and **auto-promoted → `ai-fix` by github-actions[bot] at 00:49** (not a manual CEO add — see process note below). **Premise self-verified before ratifying** (did not just trust the auto-label): read `App.js:2165` — the top-10 list pages emit **only** `Article` schema (`data-schema="top10-article"`); confirmed **no `ItemList`** on the ranked `/lists/<slug>` pages (the `ItemList` instances at `App.js:1856/4306/8924/12105/…` are the homepage collection, timeline, gear categories — different page types). Genuinely net-new vs #1069 (ItemList on the *unordered* `/drummers` roster), #1075 (BreadcrumbList), #1064 (Article from `ALBUM_ARTICLES`). Atomic, one block. Impact **~6⭐** — Médio ⭐⭐⭐ (list/carousel rich result + LLM ranked-entity extraction "who is the #1 fastest metal drummer" on the proven-organic informational surface), Longo ⭐⭐ (citation anchor, both KPIs), Curto ⭐ (indexes over weeks). **Kept in queue.**
2. **Merged the CLEAN log-only PR #1085** (Week 3 audit-hold, `seo-plan.md` +7/−1, squash + branch deleted). It carries the latest footer + correctly flags the prior log PR #1084 as `DIRTY`.
3. **Left #1084 open** (the #1083-filing log) — it's `CONFLICTING`/`DIRTY` on `seo-plan.md` and the SEO Agent **self-flagged it for rebase** in #1085 ("rebases/resolves on next merge"). `seo-plan.md` has a `merge=union` driver specifically to absorb this; the SEO Agent owns that file. Did **not** force-resolve (clobber risk) or close (its #1083-finding entry has log value). It will union-merge on the SEO Agent's next run. PR queue: 1 open (this known-conflicting log).
4. **No new feature/SEO issues filed** — anti-noise hold continues (rationale below).

### Drain-rate watch — the headline signal
- **Last Ralph *implementation* PR merged: #1070 (#1007 internal-linking) at 06-12 14:03 UTC** — ~17h ago. Everything merged since is SEO/CEO **run-logs** (#1073/#1076/#1079/#1081/#1082), not code. The `ai-fix` queue is **19-deep and not draining overnight**.
- **Read:** this is an *overnight* gap (00:00–07:00 UTC), and the queue **did** drain healthily during 06-12 daytime (#1070 + lick batches #1040/#1041). So the implementer is schedule-bound, not dead. The binding constraint remains **implementer/merge throughput (#909 no-consumer / #1060 auto-merge), not idea supply** — exactly as called the last 6 touches. Filing more into a 19-deep non-overnight-draining queue inflates WIP, not throughput.
- **Quota override (justified):** the deep-run quota (≥3 programmatic + ≥1 LLM issue) is subordinate to the WIP-discipline guardrail ("resist backlog inflation"). Holding. Will re-file the instant the queue shows real drain headroom OR a 🔴 broken-SEO override appears.

### Process note — ai-fix promotion is now automated
`#1083` was promoted to `ai-fix` by **github-actions[bot]**, not a manual CEO `gh issue edit`. The triage *approval* step appears automated now. **The CEO quality-gate still applies** — I verified #1083's premise post-hoc and would have stripped `ai-fix` + closed had it been a duplicate or false premise. Flagging so future runs check fresh proposals' premises even when they arrive pre-labeled.

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** 0 untriaged (API-verified — all carry `ai-fix`). #1083 ratified post-verify.
- ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty.
- ⛔ **GSC-gap escalation:** still blind (#910). Held — no re-spam. First real escalations file the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.
- ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic. #984 (>3d) atomic + founder-blocked on #987. Lick batches #1047–1050 atomic but intentionally held behind #1056 (modularize `signatureLicks.js`). No `ceo-aggressive` open. No split warranted.
- ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **PR queue:** 1 merged, 1 left (known SEO-log conflict for union-rebase).

### Next Run (2026-06-13 13:00 mid-day pulse)
1. **Drain check** — did Ralph open implementation PRs during 06-13 daytime? If still zero by mid-day, the overnight read was wrong and #909/#1060 (consumer/merge) need a consolidated status escalation to Ricardo, not silence.
2. **#1084** — confirm the SEO Agent rebased/union-merged it; if still `DIRTY` after the next SEO run, merge-resolve myself.
3. **#1056 first** — sequence the `signatureLicks.js` modularization before lick batches #1047–1050 (append-serialization tax on the 171KB monolith).
4. **#1062 → then #1078** — honor the same-`WebSite`-block sequencing (SearchAction first, Organization entity after).
5. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-13 07:00 deep run (ratified #1083 ItemList-on-ranked-lists → `ai-fix`, premise self-verified at App.js:2165 — only Article schema today, no ItemList on `/lists/<slug>`, net-new vs #1069/#1075/#1064; note: auto-promoted by github-actions[bot], CEO quality-gate still applied; merged CLEAN log PR #1085, left known-conflicting log #1084 for the SEO Agent's `merge=union` rebase; **anti-noise hold continued** — quota overridden, drain-rate confirms implementer/merge throughput #909/#1060 is the binding constraint, not idea supply; founder inbox + proposal queue empty; GSC #910 still the binding KPI blocker)*

## 2026-06-13 (Saturday) — 13:00 Mid-Day Pulse (drain-rate escalation — root cause found)

### State at start (metrics 06-13 10:45 UTC refresh)
- **GA4 (7d):** 55 active users / 61 sessions / 115 views — **Organic Search 43/61 ≈ 70%** (moat thesis holds, 4th straight week, highest organic share yet). Top pages `/` (30), `/drummers` (10), `/drummer/2` Joey Jordison (8/7u), `/quiz` (6), profiles 32/34/7/18 + `/drummer/navene-koperweis`.
- **GSC: still blind** (`GSC_SITE` missing) — #910 unmoved. #1 KPI unmeasurable. Held — no re-spam.
- **Founder inbox: empty.** Proposal queue: **0 untriaged** (all 19 `ai-fix`).
- PRs at start: 1 open — SEO run-log #1091 (CLEAN, `seo-plan.md` only).

### Headline action — honored the 07:00 pre-commitment: drain-zero by mid-day → escalate, not silence
The 07:00 run pre-committed: *"if implementation PRs are still zero by mid-day, the overnight read was wrong → consolidated escalation to Ricardo."* I checked the **root cause** instead of re-asserting "no consumer":

- **`implementer.yml` is `.disabled` — by design.** Renamed 2026-06-04 with note *"Ricardo runs Ralph locally via `.ralph/`."* The queue's consumer is a **human-triggered local Ralph**, not CI. So the overnight read was **right** (schedule/human-bound), now confirmed precisely: it's Ricardo-local, not CI-scheduled or dead.
- **Drain evidence:** last *implementation* PR #1070 merged 06-12 ~14:00 UTC; ~23h since, every merge (#1073–#1091) is a run-log, **0 implementation PRs even opened**. `ai-fix` queue **19-deep**. Saturday → Ricardo presumably away from keyboard. **Working-as-designed, not a break.**

**Escalation (proportionate, no alarm):** posted **one consolidated comment on #909** (the canonical "no consumer" issue — did NOT file a duplicate). Corrected its diagnosis (consumer = manual/local, not absent) and framed the standing structural decision for Ricardo: **(A)** keep manual/local Ralph as a batch-drained buffer, or **(B)** re-enable CI `implementer.yml` for 24/7 autonomous drain, gated behind the YouTube dead-video pre-merge check (#984/#987) as the safety rail. Included the high-leverage priority order for his next local Ralph session (#1056 first → #1062→#1078 → schema/sitemap #1069/#1072/#1075/#1083). It's an infra/risk call only Ricardo can make; no further CEO action pending his decision.

### Other actions
- **Merged CLEAN log-only PR #1091** (squash + branch deleted) — `seo-plan.md` only, the SEO Agent's Week-3-Sat audit-hold entry. PR queue → **0**.
- **No net-new feature/SEO issues filed.** Anti-noise hold continues — a 19-deep, currently-stalled queue needs drain, not more WIP. Deep-run quota remains subordinate to the WIP-discipline guardrail.

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** 0 untriaged (all `ai-fix`).
- ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty.
- ⛔ **GSC-gap escalation:** still blind (#910). Held.
- ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic. #984 (>3d) atomic + founder-blocked on #987. Lick batches #1047–1050 atomic but held behind #1056. No `ceo-aggressive` open.
- ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **PR queue drained** (1 merged, 0 open); **drain-rate escalation delivered** per pre-commitment.

### Next Run (2026-06-13 19:00 evening run)
1. **Check #909 for a Ricardo reply** on the A/B implementer decision. If he chooses (B), the follow-up is a `ai-fix` issue to re-enable `implementer.yml` gated on #987.
2. **Drain re-check** — if Ricardo ran Ralph locally during 06-13 daytime, expect implementation PRs to appear; merge when CLEAN, honoring #1056-first then #1062→#1078 sequencing.
3. **Weekly summary** — Saturday; fold week's progress + KPIs into the evening log if not already (Friday slot missed → catch up).
4. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-13 13:00 mid-day pulse (honored 07:00 pre-commitment — found root cause of the ~23h drain stall: `implementer.yml` disabled by design 06-04, consumer is manual/local Ralph, not absent; posted ONE consolidated decision comment on #909 framing the re-enable-CI A/B call for Ricardo + next-session priority order, no duplicate issue, no Saturday alarm; merged CLEAN log PR #1091 → queue 0; anti-noise hold continued — 19-deep stalled queue needs drain not WIP; GA4 organic share 70%, 4th-week moat hold; GSC #910 still the binding KPI blocker)*

## 2026-06-13 (Saturday) — 13:31 Mid-Day Re-Trigger (drain RESUMED — merged first implementation PR since #1070)

### Context
Re-invocation of the 13:00 mid-day slot (metrics auto-refreshed 13:31 UTC). The substantive mid-day pulse already shipped (#1092: drain root-cause + #909 escalation). Verified nothing changed since: founder inbox empty, **0 untriaged `seo-proposal`** (all carry `ai-fix`), **#909 — no Ricardo reply yet** (last comment is my own 10:48 framing of the A/B call). Did **not** re-run the escalation (guardrail: no re-spam).

### Headline action — the drain resumed, and I merged it
- **PR #1094 appeared at 13:20 UTC** implementing **#1042 (/licks index hub)** — **the first *implementation* PR since #1070 (06-12 ~14:00, ~23h gap).** This is real code, not a run-log.
- **Sanity-scanned the diff** before merging (not just trusting `CLEAN`): adds `/licks` to `api/sitemap.js` (priority 0.9, weekly), a `/^\/licks\/?$/i` route matcher, **self-referencing canonical**, and **ItemList + Home›Licks BreadcrumbList** JSON-LD with ListItems pointing at the live per-lick routes (`/drummers/<slug>/licks/<slug>`). Matches #1042's spec exactly. +470/−3, `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`, `MERGEABLE`.
- **Merged squash + branch deleted.** #1042 auto-closed (13:33 UTC). PR queue → **0**.
- *(Note: `gh pr checks`/`statusCheckRollup` returns "Resource not accessible by integration" from this context — a read-permission quirk, not a check failure. `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN` is authoritative and branch protection blocks merge unless required checks pass.)*

### Signal read — this validates option (A) of the #909 call
The mid-day escalation framed the structural choice: **(A)** keep manual/local Ralph as a batch-drained buffer vs **(B)** re-enable CI `implementer.yml`. **PR #1094 is direct evidence (A) works** — Ricardo's local Ralph IS draining the queue on a Saturday. The ~23h overnight gap was schedule-bound (working-as-designed), exactly as called the last 8 touches — not a dead pipeline. **No further #909 escalation today**; the merge is the evidence. Will fold this into the 19:00 evening log as the data point for Ricardo's A/B decision if he hasn't replied.

### Anti-noise hold — continued
Queue now **18-deep** `ai-fix`, all triaged, draining ~1 PR/active-session via manual Ralph. Filing net-new issues still inflates WIP, not throughput. Deep-run quota remains subordinate to the WIP-discipline guardrail. Hold stands. Will re-file the instant the queue shows real headroom or a 🔴 broken-SEO override appears.

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** 0 untriaged (all `ai-fix`).
- ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty.
- ⛔ **GSC-gap escalation:** still blind (#910). Held — no re-spam.
- ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic. #984 (>3d) atomic + founder-blocked on #987. Lick batches #1047–1050 atomic, held behind #1056. No `ceo-aggressive` open.
- ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **implementation PR #1094 merged → queue 0 open PRs, ai-fix backlog 18.**

### Next Run (2026-06-13 19:00 evening run)
1. **Drain momentum** — expect more implementation PRs if Ricardo keeps a local Ralph session going; merge each when CLEAN, honoring **#1056-first** then **#1062→#1078** sequencing.
2. **#909** — check for Ricardo's A/B reply; if none, fold the #1094-drain evidence into the evening log (favors option A — manual buffer is functioning).
3. **Weekly summary** — Saturday; fold the week's progress + KPIs into the evening log (Friday slot missed → catch up).
4. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-13 13:31 mid-day re-trigger (drain RESUMED — merged CLEAN implementation PR #1094 = #1042 /licks index hub, diff-verified sitemap+canonical+ItemList/Breadcrumb schema, first impl PR since #1070 ~23h prior → #1042 closed, queue 0 open PRs / 18 ai-fix; this validates #909 option A — manual/local Ralph is draining on a Saturday, no re-spam; anti-noise hold continued; founder inbox + proposal queue empty; GSC #910 still the binding KPI blocker)*

## 2026-06-13 (Saturday) — 19:00 Evening Run (clear PR queue, weekly summary, anti-noise hold)

### State at start (metrics fresh — 06-13 16:27 UTC refresh)
- **GA4 (7d):** 55 active users / 63 sessions / 117 views — **Organic Search 44/63 ≈ 70%** (moat thesis holds, 4th straight week at the highest organic share recorded). Top pages `/` (31, 27% of views), `/drummers` (10), `/drummer/2` Joey Jordison (9/7u — strongest long-tail profile), `/quiz` (6), profiles 32/34/7/18 + `/drummer/navene-koperweis`. Volume holding near the monthly high; engagement 68%, avg session 50s.
- **GSC: still blind** (`GSC_SITE` missing) — #910 unmoved. #1 KPI unmeasurable. Held — no re-spam.
- **Founder inbox: empty.** Proposal queue: **0 untriaged** (API-verified — all open `seo-proposal` carry `ai-fix`). ai-fix backlog **18-deep**.
- PRs at start: 1 open — SEO run-log #1096 (CLEAN, `seo-plan.md` only, post-13:31 re-trigger audit-hold entry).

### Actions
1. **Merged CLEAN log-only PR #1096** (squash + branch deleted) → **PR queue 0**. SEO Agent's Week-3-Sat post-re-trigger anti-noise-hold entry, `seo-plan.md` only.
2. **#909 — no Ricardo reply** on the A/B implementer decision (last comment is my own 10:48 UTC framing). **Did not re-spam** (guardrail). Per the 13:31 pre-commitment, folding the drain evidence here: **PR #1094 merging on a Saturday is direct proof option (A) works** — manual/local Ralph drained the queue without CI. The A/B call (keep manual buffer vs. re-enable CI `implementer.yml` gated on #987) remains Ricardo's infra/risk decision; the working evidence favors (A), so this is **not** urgent. No further escalation.
3. **No net-new feature/SEO issues filed** — anti-noise hold continues (see weekly summary).

### 📊 Weekly Summary — Week 3, ending Sat 2026-06-13 (Friday slot missed → caught up here)
**KPIs**
- **GA4 7d:** ~52→55 active users, 110→117 views across the week — **steady near the monthly high**, no decline.
- **Organic share:** 67% → **70%** week-over-week — **4th consecutive week of organic-majority traffic**. The SEO-compound moat thesis is holding empirically: organic is both the largest *and* growing channel. Direct 19/63 (~30%), no paid.
- **Top organic surface:** homepage (27% of views) + `/drummers` hub + individual drummer profiles (`/drummer/2` Joey Jordison consistently strongest long-tail at 9 views/7 users). The proven-organic pattern remains **drummer-profile + roster + quiz**, which is exactly what the queued schema/sitemap/LLM work reinforces.
- **AI-citation KPI:** still unmeasurable directly (no GSC, no citation telemetry) — proxied by LLM-surface coverage shipped (llms.md endpoints, ItemList/ranked-entity schema).

**Shipped this week (implementation PRs merged):** internal-linking #1007 (#1070), signature-lick batches #1040/#1041, and today's **/licks index hub #1042 (#1094)** — a new aggregation surface with ItemList + Breadcrumb schema over the proven-organic lick content.

**Pipeline health (the week's defining theme):** the binding constraint is **implementer/merge throughput, not idea supply** — diagnosed precisely on 06-13: `implementer.yml` is `.disabled` *by design* (06-04), so the `ai-fix` consumer is **Ricardo's manual/local Ralph**, draining in batches (~1 PR/active session, with multi-hour overnight/weekend gaps). The queue sat 18–19 deep all week. Correct CEO response — and the week's standing decision — was the **anti-noise hold**: stop inflating WIP, keep the queue triaged and sequenced (#1056-first → #1062→#1078 → schema/sitemap), and escalate the structural A/B call once (#909, no re-spam). Held WIP discipline 8+ consecutive touches.

**Carry-over into Week 4:** (1) #909 A/B implementer decision still pending Ricardo; (2) #910 GSC enablement still the #1-KPI blocker; (3) anti-noise hold stays until the queue shows real drain headroom OR a 🔴 broken-SEO override appears.

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** 0 untriaged (API-verified — all `ai-fix`).
- ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty.
- ⛔ **GSC-gap escalation:** still blind (#910). Held — no re-spam. First real escalations file the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.
- ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic open. #984 (>3d) atomic + founder-blocked on #987. Lick batches #1047–1050 atomic, intentionally held behind #1056 (modularize `signatureLicks.js`). Schema/sitemap issues (#1062–#1083) all atomic, one block each. No `ceo-aggressive` open. No split warranted.
- ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry + weekly summary); **PR queue drained** (1 merged, 0 open).

### Next Run (2026-06-14 07:00 deep run)
1. **#909** — check for Ricardo's A/B reply; if (B), file an `ai-fix` issue to re-enable `implementer.yml` gated on #987 (YouTube dead-video pre-merge check) as the safety rail.
2. **Drain re-check** — merge any CLEAN implementation PRs Ricardo's local Ralph opens overnight, honoring **#1056-first** then **#1062→#1078** (`WebSite`-block) sequencing.
3. **Anti-noise hold** — reassess: if the queue drains below ~12 with headroom, resume the deep-run quota (≥3 programmatic + ≥1 LLM issue); else hold.
4. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-13 19:00 evening run (merged CLEAN log PR #1096 → PR queue 0; logged Week-3 weekly summary — organic share 67%→70%, 4th straight organic-majority week, moat thesis holds empirically; week's defining theme = implementer throughput (manual/local Ralph, #909) is the binding constraint, not idea supply → anti-noise hold held 8+ touches; #909 no Ricardo reply, #1094 Saturday-merge folded in as evidence favoring option A, no re-spam; founder inbox + proposal queue empty; GSC #910 still the binding #1-KPI blocker)*

## 2026-06-13 (Saturday) — 19:29 Evening Re-Trigger (no-op confirmation, anti-noise hold)

### Context
Re-invocation of the 19:00 evening slot (metrics auto-refreshed 19:29 UTC). The substantive evening run already shipped (#1096: merged log PR, Week-3 weekly summary, #909 drain-evidence fold-in). Verified nothing material changed since — this is a confirmation pass, not new work.

### State delta since 19:00 (all checked, all unchanged)
- **PR queue: 0 open** (API-verified — `gh pr list` empty). No new implementation PR from Ricardo's local Ralph since #1094.
- **#909:** no Ricardo reply on the A/B implementer decision (last comment is my own 13:00 framing). **Did not re-spam** (guardrail).
- **Proposal queue:** 0 untriaged `seo-proposal` (API-verified — all carry `ai-fix`). ai-fix backlog **18-deep**.
- **Founder inbox:** empty.
- **GA4 (7d, 19:29 refresh):** 55 active users / 64 sessions / 118 views — **Organic Search 45/64 ≈ 70%**. Flat vs the 19:00 read (55/63/117); organic-majority moat thesis still holds. Top pages unchanged (`/` 31, `/drummer/2` Joey Jordison, `/drummers`, `/quiz`).
- **GSC: still blind** (`GSC_SITE` missing) — #910 unmoved.

### Action
- **Committed the 19:29 metrics.md refresh** (auto-populated by `fetch-metrics.cjs`; numbers-only delta).
- **No net-new issues, no escalation, no re-spam.** Anti-noise hold stands — an 18-deep queue draining via manual/local Ralph needs drain headroom, not more WIP. Nothing here overrides the 19:00 posture.

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** 0 untriaged. ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty. ⛔ **GSC-gap:** still blind (#910), held. ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic open. ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **PR queue 0**.

### Next Run (2026-06-14 07:00 deep run)
1. **#909** — check for Ricardo's A/B reply; if (B), file an `ai-fix` issue to re-enable `implementer.yml` gated on #987.
2. **Drain re-check** — merge any CLEAN implementation PRs from overnight local Ralph, honoring **#1056-first** → **#1062→#1078** sequencing.
3. **Anti-noise hold reassess** — if the queue drains below ~12 with headroom, resume the deep-run quota; else hold.
4. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-13 19:29 evening re-trigger (no-op confirmation pass — substantive evening run #1096 already shipped; verified 0 open PRs, #909 no Ricardo reply, 0 untriaged proposals, founder inbox empty, GA4 organic 70% flat, GSC #910 still blind; committed 19:29 metrics refresh only; anti-noise hold held, no re-spam, no net-new WIP)*

## 2026-06-13 (Saturday) — 22:21 Late Re-Trigger (NOT a no-op: drained 2 CLEAN PRs)

### Context
Late re-invocation (metrics auto-refreshed 22:21 UTC), ~3h after the 19:29 confirmation pass. Unlike the 19:29 touch, **this run had real work**: Ricardo's local Ralph opened a fresh implementation PR (#1101) after the 19:29 slot. CEO standing job = merge CLEAN PRs → done.

### Actions taken
- **Merged PR #1101** (`feat(seo): add /llms/licks.md` — impl of #1045) — author ricardoparro/local Ralph, MERGEABLE/CLEAN, +1051/-0. Adds the signature-lick database as ingestible markdown for AI crawlers (GPTBot/ClaudeBot/PerplexityBot) + a generator (`generate-llms-licks.cjs`) keeping it in sync with `signatureLicks.js`, plus sitemap + llms.txt wiring. Mirrors the proven `/llms/{index,faq,gear-guide}.md` pattern. **Directly advances the AI-citation KPI** over our best-performing organic surface (licks). Non-generated diff reviewed (sitemap/llms.txt/generator) — sane. Issue **#1045 auto-closed** on merge.
- **Merged PR #1100** (SEO audit-only log, `seo-plan.md`, +7/-1). Went stale-behind-base after #1101 landed → `update-branch` → CI re-ran (BLOCKED→CLEAN over ~80s) → squash-merged. (Repo auto-merge still disabled — the #1060 friction; had to hand-hold the merge.)
- **Committed the 22:21 metrics.md refresh** (numbers-only auto-populate).

### State delta since 19:29
- **PR queue: 2 → 0** (both merged this run).
- **ai-fix backlog: 18 → 17** (#1045 closed via #1101 merge). Still above the ~12 resume threshold → **anti-noise hold continues**.
- **#909:** still no Ricardo reply (last comment is my own 13:00 framing). **No re-spam.**
- **Proposal queue:** 0 untriaged `seo-proposal` (API-verified). **Founder inbox:** empty. **GSC:** still blind (#910).
- **GA4 (7d, 22:21):** 55 users / 64 sessions / 118 views — Organic 45/64 ≈ 70%. Flat vs 19:29; organic-majority moat thesis holds.

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** 0 untriaged. ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty. ⛔ **GSC-gap:** still blind (#910), held. ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic open. ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **PR queue drained to 0** (2 merged).

### Next Run (2026-06-14 07:00 deep run)
1. **#909** — check for Ricardo's A/B reply; if (B), file an `ai-fix` issue to re-enable `implementer.yml` gated on #987.
2. **Drain re-check** — merge any CLEAN implementation PRs from overnight local Ralph, honoring **#1056-first** → **#1062→#1078** sequencing.
3. **Anti-noise hold reassess** — queue at 17; if it drains below ~12 with headroom, resume the deep-run quota (≥3 programmatic + ≥1 LLM); else hold.
4. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-13 22:21 late re-trigger (NOT a no-op — merged 2 CLEAN PRs: impl #1101 /llms/licks.md advancing the AI-citation KPI over our best-performing organic surface → #1045 closed, and SEO log #1100 after update-branch; PR queue 2→0, ai-fix backlog 18→17, still above ~12 resume threshold → anti-noise hold continues; #909 no reply/no re-spam, proposals + founder inbox empty, GA4 organic 70% flat, GSC #910 still blind; committed 22:21 metrics refresh)*

## 2026-06-13 (Saturday) — 23:26 Late Re-Trigger (no-op confirmation, anti-noise hold)

### Context
Late re-invocation (metrics auto-refreshed 23:26 UTC), ~1h after the 22:21 drain run. The substantive evening work already shipped: 22:21 merged impl #1101 (/llms/licks.md → #1045 closed) + log #1100; 19:00 logged the Week-3 weekly summary. Verified nothing material changed since → confirmation pass, not new work.

### State delta since 22:21 (all API-checked, all unchanged)
- **PR queue: 0 open** (`gh pr list` empty). No new implementation PR from local Ralph since #1101.
- **#909:** no Ricardo reply on the A/B implementer decision (last comment is my own mid-day framing). **No re-spam** (guardrail).
- **Proposal queue:** 0 untriaged `seo-proposal` (all carry `ai-fix`). ai-fix backlog **17-deep** — still above the ~12 resume threshold → **anti-noise hold continues**.
- **Founder inbox:** empty. **GSC:** still blind (`GSC_SITE` missing, #910).
- **GA4 (7d, 23:26):** 55 active users / 64 sessions / 118 views — Organic 45/64 ≈ 70%. **Identical** to the 22:21 read; organic-majority moat thesis holds.

### Action
- **Committed the 23:26 metrics.md refresh** (auto-populated; timestamp/rerun touch — numbers identical to 22:21).
- **No net-new issues, no escalation, no re-spam.** Anti-noise hold stands — a 17-deep queue draining via manual/local Ralph needs drain headroom, not more WIP. Nothing here overrides the 22:21 posture.

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** 0 untriaged. ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty. ⛔ **GSC-gap:** still blind (#910), held — no re-spam. ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic open. ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **PR queue 0**.

## 2026-06-14 (Sunday) — 01:49 Early Re-Trigger (merged 1 CLEAN log PR, anti-noise hold)

### Context
Off-schedule early-Sunday re-invocation (metrics auto-refreshed 01:49 UTC), ~2.5h after the 23:26 Sat no-op confirmation. Not a pure no-op: the SEO Agent opened its Week-3 Sun audit-only hold log PR (#1105) at 00:51 UTC. CEO standing job = merge CLEAN PRs → done.

### Action taken
- **Merged PR #1105** (`seo: 2026-06-14 Week 3 Sun run — audit-only anti-noise hold`) — author github-actions/SEO Agent, MERGEABLE/CLEAN, +8/-1, `seo-plan.md` only (log surface, no code/schema change). Squash + branch deleted → **PR queue 0**.
- **Committed the 01:49 metrics.md refresh** (auto-populated by `fetch-metrics.cjs`; numbers-only delta).

### State delta since 23:26 (all API-checked)
- **PR queue: 1 → 0** (#1105 merged this run).
- **ai-fix backlog: 17-deep** — unchanged, still above the ~12 resume threshold → **anti-noise hold continues**.
- **#909:** no Ricardo reply on the A/B implementer decision (last comment is my own 06-13 13:00 framing). **No re-spam** (guardrail).
- **Proposal queue:** 0 untriaged `seo-proposal` (API-verified — all carry `ai-fix`). **Founder inbox:** empty. **GSC:** still blind (`GSC_SITE` missing, #910).
- **GA4 (7d, 01:49):** 51 active users / 60 sessions / 108 views — Organic 42/60 ≈ 70%. In-band with the weekend reads; organic-majority moat thesis holds.

### Quota check

## 2026-06-16 (Tuesday) — Mid-day Pulse (UNBLOCK: cleared the 3-deep PR queue, re-armed 2 stalled ai-fix issues against the #1056 modular pattern)

### Context
First substantive CEO run since the 06-14 weekend. Metrics auto-refreshed 11:44 UTC. Pipeline confirmed **healthy, not broken**: 7 PRs merged in the last 3 days (#1117→#1121 on 06-15/16). #909's "no consumer" alarm remains correctly diagnosed (06-13) as working-as-designed — local/human-gated Ralph drains the queue in sessions. This is the mid-day-pulse mandate executed literally: *check Ralph's progress, unblock if needed.* There was real blockage to clear.

### The block: #1056 (merged #1120, 06-15) obsoleted 2 in-flight lick PRs
PR #1120 modularized the licks data into `packages/frontend/data/licks/<slug>.js` (one module per drummer) + made `api/sitemap.js` derive lick/hub URLs programmatically — explicitly to **kill the merge-conflict serialization** that stalled lick-batch PRs (#1032/#1039/#1040). Side effect: the two open lick PRs authored against the *old* monolithic `signatureLicks.js` + hand-maintained sitemap arrays went **CONFLICTING/DIRTY** and their diffs got tangled with already-merged drummers (Benante/Adler from #1113). A rebase was riskier than a clean re-cut. All 3 open PRs were unmergeable.

### Actions taken
- **Closed PR #1114** (Jay Weinberg + Gavin Harrison → #1049) — structurally obsoleted by #1056; branch preserved for data reference.
- **Closed PR #1115** (Mike Mangini + Pete Sandoval → #1050) — same cause; branch preserved.
- **Closed PR #1111** (06-14 Week-3-Sun audit-only HOLD log) — stale + superseded, CONFLICTING on `metrics.md`, no code/schema to salvage.
- **Re-armed #1049 + #1050** (both stay open / `ai-fix`) with a precise **new-file-op recipe**: create `data/licks/<slug>.js` per drummer + one import/spread line in `data/licks/index.js`; **do NOT touch `api/sitemap.js`** (auto-derives now); **every `video.youtubeId` must pass the now-live PR YouTube gate (#984, wired #1116)**; keep `npm test` green. Verified the 4 drummers are absent from `licks/` — the work is genuinely undelivered, not duplicated.
- **Committed the 11:44 metrics.md refresh.**
- (Note: `gh pr close --comment` 401'd on the fork-authored PRs #1114/#1115 — closed them bare, then put the full diagnosis + recipe on the main-repo **issues** where it persists for the implementer.)

### State delta
- **PR queue: 3 → 0** (all unmergeable; closed, not merged).
- **ai-fix backlog: 9** — down from 17-18 over the weekend (Ricardo drained it). Now **below the ~12 anti-noise resume threshold**, but two of the nine (#1049/#1050) are freshly re-armed WIP and this is a pulse slot, so → **held net-new filing this run**; flagged the next 07:00 deep run to resume the deep-run quota (≥3 programmatic + ≥1 LLM).
- **GA4 (7d, 11:44):** 48 active users / 56 sessions / 79 views — **Organic Search 44/56 ≈ 79%**. Organic-majority moat thesis holds (strongest organic share read yet).
- **#909:** no new Ricardo reply; no re-spam. **GSC: still blind** (`GSC_SITE` missing, #910).
- **Founder inbox:** empty. **Proposal queue:** 0 untriaged `seo-proposal` (all carry `ai-fix`).

### Quota check
- ✅ **SEO proposals:** 0 untriaged. ✅ **Founder ideas:** inbox empty. ⛔ **GSC-gap:** still blind (#910), held — no re-spam. ✅ **Atomic-split sweep:** nothing non-atomic open (#1064 is broad-sounding but a single-file wiring change = 1 PR; not split). ✅ **Decisions logged** (this entry); **PR queue drained 3→0; 2 stalled ai-fix issues unblocked.**

### Next Run (2026-06-16 19:00 evening / or next deep run)
1. **Resume deep-run quota** — backlog at 9 (<12) with headroom; the weekend anti-noise rationale (deep stalled queue) no longer holds. File ≥3 programmatic + ≥1 LLM-content issue, anchored on the best-performing organic surfaces (drummer pages, licks).
2. **Watch for re-cut PRs on #1049/#1050** — merge when CLEAN (now trivial new-file ops; should pass the YouTube gate).
3. **#910 GSC** — file the first real GSC-gap escalations the instant `GSC_SITE` lands.
4. **#909/#1060** — no re-spam; surface again only if drain demonstrably stalls or Ricardo replies on the A/B implementer decision / auto-merge.

*Última revisão: CEO Agent — 2026-06-16 mid-day pulse (UNBLOCK run: #1056 modularization obsoleted 2 in-flight lick PRs → closed all 3 unmergeable PRs #1111/#1114/#1115, PR queue 3→0; re-armed #1049/#1050 with the new-file-op recipe + live-YouTube-gate reminder, both stay ai-fix; ai-fix backlog 9 (<12 threshold) → held net-new filing this pulse slot, flagged next deep run to resume quota; GA4 organic 79% — strongest organic share yet; founder inbox + proposal queue empty; GSC #910 still blind, #909 no re-spam; committed 11:44 metrics refresh)*
