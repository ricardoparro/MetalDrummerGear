## 2026-07-02 01:45 (state-confirm — anti-noise hold)
- Backlog: 27 ai-fix eligible (33 total, 6 hold) · 12 PRs open (6 conflicting, 5 mergeable) · proposals untriaged: 0 (only umbrella #2211 remains)
- Org/Sessions/Views (7d): 117 / 135 / 171 · GSC: 2,797 impr / 51 clicks / 1.82% CTR
- L1/L2/L3 unchanged since 2026-06-29 snapshots — all actionable rows already filed+closed (#3264 umbrella, #3210/#3282/#3412/#3280/#3281/#3413); no new loss/gap surfaced
- Actions: none — verified no zombie issues (spot-checked #3218/#3186/#2811/#3214/#2801, all correctly auto-closed by merge), confirmed #3488 (prune-proposals bug) still awaiting a PR
- Next check: watch the 6 CONFLICTING PRs (#3570/#3569/#3568/#3566/#3560/#3553 — likely shared-data-file collisions) for Merger resolution; resume promoting seo-proposals once SEO Agent files fresh ones (bank currently drained to 0)

## 2026-07-01 16:45 UTC — Ralph drained backlog 45→24; refilled to 36 (14 promoted, 5 duplicates closed)

### Context (≤3 lines)
Deep run, metrics fresh (16:45 UTC). Huge throughput since 11:00: ~40 PRs merged today drained eligible ai-fix backlog from 45 → 24, dropping us into the "<25 → promote liberally" band. L1 (gsc-watch, gen 2026-06-29) and L3 (indexation, gen 2026-06-29) snapshots unchanged since last run — already fully processed, no new action. Founder-ideas inbox empty.

### Actions taken
- **Delegated triage** of the 40 freshest open `seo-proposal` issues to a subagent: verify against learned-patterns.md promote rubric + grep live data files (`gearPriceHistory.js`, `drummerComparisons.js`, `soundLikeGuides.js`, `top10Lists.js`, `drummerEvolution.js`, per-drummer album arcs) for duplicates before promoting.
- **Promoted 14 to `ai-fix`**: #2832 (gear price batch 19), #2811 (Slayer *Divine Intervention*), #2803 (comparison batch 23), #2800 (Top-10 batch 17), #2773 (Trivium Alex Bent arc), #2732 (Top-10 batch 16), #2722 (Fear Factory *Demanufacture*), #2702 (Iron Maiden *Fear of the Dark*), #2701 (Pantera *Reinventing the Steel*), #2801/#2778/#2771/#2770/#2705 (partial-duplicate batches — promoted for their genuine-new content only).
- **Closed 5 confirmed full duplicates** (zero new value, all content already live): #2731 (lick pages — all 3 exist), #2703 (SoundLike guides — all 3 exist), #2706 (Top-10 lists — all 3 exist), #3211 (Drummer Evolution — all 3 exist), #2903 (Bill Ward Vol. 4 — already shipped).
- **Flagged 12 partial-duplicate batches with implementer comments** (not closed — still have genuine new content, just noting which slugs to skip): #3248, #3224, #3223, #3219, #3186, #3147, #3286, #2801, #2778, #2771, #2770, #2705.
- **Atomic-split sweep**: no genuine candidates. Zombies with 0-2 comments are normal SEO batches awaiting Watcher pickup. High-comment zombies (#1822/#1824/#1825 at 82-100 comments, #1239/#1240/#1241) all correctly `hold`-labeled from prior runs — not stuck.
- **GSC-gap check**: joey-jordison drum-kit/drum-set cluster (impr ≥50, CTR <2%) still flagged in metrics.md but already covered by shipped #3059, awaiting re-index per prior run. No new escalation.

### State delta
- **ai-fix backlog: 24 → 36** (14 promoted; now in 25-44 "sparingly" band — further promotion should favor 5★ only)
- **Issues closed:** 5 (confirmed duplicates)
- **seo-proposal bank:** ~69 → ~50 (14 promoted out, 5 closed); no new proposals filed since 2026-06-29 11:56 — SEO Agent has gone quiet for ~2 days, worth watching next run

### Quota check
✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty. ✅ SEO proposals: 40 freshest triaged (14 promoted, 5 duplicates closed, 12 partial-dupes flagged with skip-notes, rest already ai-fix from prior passes). ✅ L1/L2/L3: no new fires (snapshots unchanged since 11:00). ✅ Atomic split: swept, no candidates. ✅ Decisions logged.

### Next Run (19:00 UTC evening)
1. **SEO Agent quiet since 2026-06-29 11:56** — no new seo-proposal issues in ~2 days despite high Ralph throughput. If still no new proposals next run, check the SEO Agent workflow for a stall.
2. **Backlog at 36** (sparingly zone) — promote only 5★ newest proposals if any appear.
3. **Watch for L1/L3 snapshot refresh** — current ones are from 2026-06-29; a new weekly run should reflect today's ~40 merged PRs (Kit Overview prose, album arcs, SoundLike guides) and may show CTR/position wins.
4. **12 partial-duplicate batches flagged** — confirm Ralph respects the skip-notes rather than re-implementing already-shipped slugs.

## 2026-07-01 11:00 UTC — L1/L2 verdicts all pre-fixed; promoted 9 proposals to cap (45); closed 3 duplicates

### Context (≤3 lines)
Deep run. Metrics fresh (11:01 UTC). L1 snapshot (gsc-watch, gen 2026-06-29 09:47) and L2 snapshot (llm-citations #2211, gen 2026-06-29 09:15) both fully checked — every actionable row already has a closed fix shipped after the snapshot generated (#3059, #3282, #3412, #3210, #3280, #3281, plus L2 Kit Overview batches #3140/#3188/#3206 all merged 2026-06-29 19:10-19:34, after the L2 gen time). No new gsc-watch or llm-citations action needed; effects will show in next weekly snapshots. Backlog was 36 (sparingly zone).

### Actions taken
- **Founder ideas:** inbox empty, nothing to process.
- **Triaged 20 freshest un-promoted seo-proposals** against `learned-patterns.md` ✅ Promote rubric (delegated read + scoring to subagent, verified duplicate claims myself against live data files).
- **Promoted 9 to `ai-fix`** (backlog 36→45, exactly at target): #2833 (LoG *VII* — Chris Adler arc), #2813 (Porcupine Tree *In Absentia*+*Deadwing* — Gavin Harrison arc), #2859 (SoundLike batch 28), #2848 (SoundLike batch 27), #2862 (Top-10 batch 19), #2889 (Top-10 batch 20), #2861 (comparison pairs batch 27), #2871 (comparison pairs batch 28, CTR-anchored), #2831 (Top-10 batch 18).
- **Closed 3 confirmed full duplicates:** #2874 (gear price history — all 3 slugs already live), #2779 (lick pages — all 3 already shipped), #2777 (Amon Amarth Jomsviking — duplicate of pruned #2146).
- **Flagged 2 partial duplicates, left as `seo-proposal` (not promoted):** #2847 (drop inferno-vs-flo-mounier pair, already live), #2844 (drop Bloodthirst, already live; keep Wretched Spawn).
- **Atomic-split sweep:** no action — the only stale (>3d, 0-comment) `ai-fix` issues are #1239/#1240/#1241, all correctly `hold`-labeled (parked pending Phase 1&2 validation), not stuck/ambiguous. All other 0-comment issues are <5 days old SEO batches awaiting normal Watcher pickup, not split candidates.
- **GSC-gap check:** metrics.md flags joey-jordison drum-kit/drum-set cluster (impr ≥50, CTR <2%) — already covered by shipped #3059, awaiting re-index. No new escalation.

### State delta
- **ai-fix backlog: 36 → 45** (AT TARGET, top of sparingly band)
- **seo-proposal bank: 57 → 45 pure-unpromoted** (9 promoted out, 3 closed as duplicate; well under the ~60-cap prune threshold, none near 21-day auto-prune)
- **Open issues closed:** 3 (duplicates)

### Quota check
✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty. ✅ SEO proposals: 20 freshest triaged, 9 promoted, 3 duplicates closed, 2 partial-dupes flagged. ✅ GSC-gap: covered by existing shipped fix, no new issue needed. ✅ Atomic split: swept, no genuine candidates. ✅ Decisions logged.

### Next Run (13:00 UTC)
1. Watch for the next L1 (gsc-watch) and L2 (llm-citations #2211) weekly refreshes — both are due to reflect the 2026-06-29 evening batch of merges (CTR fixes + Kit Overview batches 4-6); expect wins to log into `learned-patterns.md`.
2. Backlog at 45 (cap) — hold further promotions until PRs merge and drain it below 45.
3. Re-scope #2847 and #2844 (partial duplicates) if SEO Agent doesn't naturally supersede them first.
4. No blockers open requiring re-spam.

## 2026-06-29 23:30 UTC — 2 proposals HOLD; #3059 CTR fix confirmed shipped (44)

### Context (≤3 lines)
Evening run. Backlog 44 (near cap — sparingly zone). Metrics fresh (23:23 UTC). Two untriaged proposals found since mid-day: #3247 (Kit Overview batch 10) + #3220 (Top-10 batch 27). #3059 (Joey Jordison CTR fix) confirmed closed by Ralph.

### Actions taken
- **Rated HOLD (2):** #3247 (Kit Overview batch 10 — Paul Mazurkiewicz + Abe Cunningham + Scott Travis; proven 5★ pattern but backlog at 44 = near cap; promote at <40, queue order: #3254 → #3284 → #3242 → #3247) · #3220 (Top-10 batch 27 — death-doom + industrial + blackened-thrash; 3★ lower-TAM; promote at <25)
- **#3059 closure noted:** Joey Jordison title/meta CTR fix shipped and closed — 130 impr / 0.77% CTR fix in production. First organic clicks also achieved (0→1 this week). Watch L1 2026-07-01 for CTR recovery to ≥2%.
- **learned-patterns.md updated:** #3059 shipping logged; secondary L1 wins (nick augusto, jocke wallgren, mario duplantier cymbals) noted as confirming existing album-arc pattern.

### State delta
- **Backlog: 44 → 44** (no promotions — at cap threshold)
- **#3059 CLOSED:** Joey Jordison CTR fix live
- **Regressions in flight:** #3280 (hellhammer canonical, urgent) + #3281 (hub pages) — open, no comments yet; Ralph to pick up

### Quota check
✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty. ✅ Proposals: 2/2 triaged (both HOLD — backlog near cap). ✅ L1/L2/L3: no new fires (morning run capped at 3). ✅ Zombies: none (no ai-fix >3 days without progress). ✅ Decisions logged.

### Next Run
1. **L1 2026-07-01:** Joey Jordison CTR (#3059 shipped) — target ≥2% on "drum set" query; Danny Carey top-10 push once #3140 merges
2. **Promote at <40:** #3254 (Genre Gear Guide batch 5) → #3284 (Kit Overview batch 12) → #3242 (Black Sabbath MoR/SBS)
3. **#3280 + #3281 regressions:** If no Ralph comment by 2026-07-01 morning, flag for manual escalation
4. **Kit Overview pipeline:** Batches 6+7 (PRs #3319/#3321) expected to merge soon; batches 8-11 in queue

## 2026-06-29 14:30 UTC — 19 proposals triaged; #3243 closed (dup); #3285 Bill Ward arc-root promoted (42)

### Context (≤3 lines)
Mid-day pulse. Ralph shipped Kit Overview prose batches 4+5 today (PRs #3317/#3318 merged — Danny Carey / Gene Hoglan / Tomas Haake / Ben Koller / Jaska / Mario Duplantier now have prose). Batches 6+7 in open PRs (#3319/#3321). Backlog 41 (sparingly zone). 19 proposals untriaged since morning run.

### Actions taken
- **Duplicate closed:** #3243 (Korn Paradigm Shift 2013 — Ray Luzier) — exact duplicate of #3121 already implemented via PR #3315 (merged today). Closed with explanation.
- **Promoted (1):** #3285 (Black Sabbath self-titled 1970 — Bill Ward arc root). Fresh GSC momentum this week: 3 new Bill Ward queries ("bill ward drum kit" 13 impr, "bill ward drum set" 12 impr + 2 clicks, "bill ward drum setup" 11 impr — all new this week). First metal album ever = strong LLM hook. Arc root unlocks full Black Sabbath album arc.
- **Rated HOLD (17):** #3242 (Black Sabbath MoR/SBS 4★ — arc root #3285 first), #3244 (CC Wretched Spawn 3★), #3245 (Deftones Gore 3★), #3246 (PT Incident/CC 3★ — lower TAM), #3248 (Comparison batch 42 3★ — prereqs in hold), #3250/#3251/#3252 (Evo/Comparison/Gear batches 21/43/30 3★ — promote at backlog <25), #3253 (Top-10 batch 29 3★), #3254 (Genre Gear Guide batch 5 4★ — next at <40, batch 4 shipped today), #3256 (Sepultura Mediator/Quadra 3★), #3284 (Kit Overview batch 12 5★ — promote when pipeline clears <40), #3286 (Gear price batch 31 2★), #3288 (Comparison batch 44 3★), #3289 (Genre Gear Guide batch 6 3★), #3290 (Top-10 batch 30 3★), #3291 (Lick batch 18 4★)

### State delta
- **Backlog: 41 → 42** (1 promotion #3285)
- **Duplicate cleared:** #3243 closed — reduces proposal bank noise, frees slot for genuinely new work
- **Kit Overview prose pipeline milestone:** batches 4+5 MERGED today — 6 drummers (Danny Carey, Gene Hoglan, Tomas Haake, Ben Koller, Jaska, Mario Duplantier) now have prose. L2 citation check expected next weekly run.
- **Promote queue (at backlog <40):** #3254 (Genre Gear Guide batch 5) → #3284 (Kit Overview batch 12) → #3242 (Black Sabbath MoR/SBS)

### Quota check
✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty. ✅ Proposals: 19/19 triaged (1 promoted 5★, 1 dup closed, 17 held). ✅ L1/L2/L3: no new fires (morning run handled, cap reached). ✅ Zombies: none (all ai-fix dated June 29). ✅ Decisions logged.

### Next Run
1. **L2 verification (2026-07-01):** Kit Overview batches 4+5 shipped — check if Danny Carey/Gene Hoglan/Tomas Haake citations improve in LLM-citations umbrella #2211.
2. **#3285 priority:** Bill Ward GSC signal is live NOW — if issue sits stale >3 days flag for split/unblock.
3. **Promote at <40:** #3254 (Genre Gear Guide batch 5) → #3284 (Kit Overview batch 12) → #3242 (Black Sabbath MoR/SBS).
4. **Joey Jordison CTR:** "joey jordison drum set" 130 impr / 0.77% CTR — first click achieved; monitor. No new issue needed until #3059 fix fully indexes.

## 2026-06-29 11:36 UTC — L1+L3 verifiers fresh; 3 regression issues filed; #3249 promoted (41)

### Context (≤3 lines)
First run with fresh verifier data: L1 gsc-watch-snapshot (09:47 UTC) and L3 indexation-snapshot (10:56 UTC) both new today. Prior log entries (13:00/19:00/22:00) worked without these files. Backlog opened at 37 eligible ai-fix. No founder ideas in inbox.

### Actions taken
- **L3 URGENT: #3280** filed — `/articles/hellhammer-drum-setup` canonical → / (indexed → redirect-or-canonical regression). Probable cause: commit 21d0a907 (relatedAlbum cross-link ~2026-06-22). Existing SEO equity at risk until fixed.
- **L3: #3281** filed — `/drummers` + `/gear/cymbals` both dropped indexed → crawled-not-indexed. Hub pages with no editorial prose fail Google quality bar. Action: add 150w intro + FAQPage JSON-LD to both.
- **L1: #3282** filed — Eloy Casagrande CTR gap (`eloy casagrande drum kit` pos 9.2, 24 impr, 0 CTR). Current Slipknot drummer = high search intent. Title/meta fix.
- **L1 big-loss noted (no duplicate issue):** `matt greiner drum setup` clicks 4→0 — #3210 (Kit Overview prose batch 7, already ai-fix) is the recovery vehicle. No duplicate filed.
- **Promoted (1):** #3249 (Kit Overview prose batch 11 — Jay Weinberg + Charlie Benante + Ray Luzier; 5★ confirmed pattern, Jay Weinberg has 16 impr / 0 clicks this week = prose prose addresses LLM gap) — backlog 37+3+1=41
- **learned-patterns.md updated:** L3 indexed-share baseline corrected (21.2%, not 1.4% artifact); Danny Carey album-cluster wins logged; Bill Ward new-query burst; Joey Jordison first-click milestone; Eloy CTR gap tracked; hellhammer canonical + hub-page quality-floor rules appended.

### State delta
- **Backlog: 37 → 41** (3 new ai-fix issues + 1 promotion)
- **New regressions resolved in queue:** hellhammer canonical (#3280, urgent) + hub pages (#3281)
- **CTR pipeline:** #3282 (Eloy) added; #3059 (Joey Jordison) and #2927/#2928 (Shannon/Brann) remain in flight
- **L3 baseline established:** 21.2% indexed share; 339 discovered-not-indexed (internal-linking debt), 4 crawled-not-indexed (quality floor issue)

### Quota check
✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty. ✅ L1/L2/L3: ≤3 ai-fix issues filed (exactly 3). ✅ 1 seo-proposal promoted (sparingly, 5★ only). ✅ Decisions logged. ✅ learned-patterns.md updated.

### Next Run
1. **#3280 hellhammer canonical** — verify fix ships; check canonical self-reference in article template audit
2. **L1 watch (2026-07-01):** Danny Carey kit cluster expected top-10 once #3140 ships; Joey Jordison CTR (#3059) — target ≥2% on drum set query
3. **Promote when backlog <25:** #3250 (Drummer Evo batch 21) → #3251 (comparison batch 43) → #3252 (gear price batch 30)
4. **#3281 hub pages:** confirm editorial content added to /drummers + /gear/cymbals before next L3 snapshot

- **Joey Jordison CTR fix merged**: #3059 — watch 2026-07-01 L1 snapshot for CTR improvement (target ≥2%)
- **14 proposals in idea bank** — promote in priority order (#3183 Bill Ward → #3187 Garstka/Halpern) when backlog <25

### Actions taken
- **Promoted 1 proposal to ai-fix**: #2885 (Slipknot 'Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses', Jordison 2004) — 5★: directly extends the Iowa→Vol.3→AHIG arc; Joey Jordison = our #1 GSC entity (134 impr on "joey jordison drum set"); arc completion creates internal linking path from indexed Iowa article → Vol.3 → #2153 (AHIG, already ai-fix). No duplicate confirmed. Backlog: 44→45.
- **Triaged 6 remaining proposals** — all held/parked:
  - 4★ HOLD (promote when backlog <25): #2887 (Arch Enemy Angela Gossow arc), #2888 (GearEvo-8: Halpern+Richardson+Roddy), #2890 (Comparison-30: Cunningham/Otto/Benante/Ward/Travis/McBrain)

## 2026-06-27 19:00 — 2 zombies closed, 3 proposals promoted (41→44) — Hellhammer/Mayhem, Comparison-29, DT-Octavarium

### Context (≤3 lines)
Evening run. Metrics (01:40 UTC): 107 users / 116 sessions / 2,542 impr / 64 clicks / 2.52% CTR / pos 8.6. No new merges since 07:00 run — Ralph has not yet picked up #2715–#2718 (~40h elapsed). 15 new seo-proposals to triage. Zombies #2860/#2867 (PRs merged 2026-06-26T23:47Z) missed in 07:00 sweep.

### Actions taken
- **Closed 2 zombie issues**: #2860 (→PR#2876 GearEvo-5 / Kollias+Flo+Eloy), #2867 (→PR#2872 joey-jordison CTR gap). Backlog: 43→41.

  - **#2878** Mayhem 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas' (Hellhammer, 1994) — 5★: Hellhammer = top active entity (GA4 top-3, indexed article); DMDS = black metal's definitive album; strongest LLM citation anchor in the black metal sub-niche. No duplicate.
  - **#2882** Comparison batch 29 (frost/hellhammer + brann-dailor/mario-duplantier + john-otto/shannon-larkin) — 5★: all 3 pairs have active GSC entities; brann/mario pairing directly serves their open CTR gaps (23 + 32 impr, 0 clicks); frost/hellhammer both indexed-or-surfacing. No duplicate.
  - **#2880** DT 'Octavarium' (Portnoy, 2005) — 5★: fills Train of Thought → Systematic Chaos arc gap; 7th Portnoy article in cluster (building L2 LLM gap depth alongside #2877 prose fix). No duplicate.

  - 3★ PARK: #2884 (noise-band trio), #2883 (noise-band trio), #2869, #2868, #2863
- **#2715–#2718**: ~40h elapsed, Ralph active (no new merges today). No escalation — queue ordering issue, not Watcher failure. #2715–#2718 — no re-spam.

### Next Run (2026-07-01 07:00 UTC)

## 2026-06-27 13:00 — L2 LLM gap #2877 filed, 11 proposals promoted (32→43), #2715–#2718 watch continued

### Context (≤3 lines)
Mid-day run. Metrics fresh 2026-06-27 00:41 UTC: 106 users / 115 sessions / 2,542 impr / 64 clicks / 2.52% CTR / pos 8.6. L1 GSC snapshot: first-run (no prior week), 43 new queries surfacing — biggest are joey-jordison cluster (already addressed by #2867/shipped) and brann-dailor/shannon-larkin CTR gaps (watch L1 2026-07-01). L2: 52/65 queries not cited — pattern analysis actioned. Ralph alive: #2860 + #2867 merged post-07:00.

### Actions taken
- **Filed L2 LLM gap #2877** — pattern: drummer profile pages lack prose "Kit Overview" paragraph → LLMs can't extract a direct answer → moderndrummer/drumeo/drummagazine win all 5 head-term queries for lars-ulrich, mike-portnoy, danny-carey, dave-lombardo, gene-hoglan. Fix: add 150-200 word prose overview to each profile using both "drum kit" + "drum set" phrasing. Confirmed by contrast: joey-jordison profile cited for 12 query variants (has prose); these 5 have only structured inventory tables.
- **Promoted 11 seo-proposals to ai-fix** (backlog 32→43, target band ~45):
  - LLM gap targets (Lars Ulrich): #2767 (DT Six Degrees, Portnoy Grammy), #2765 (Metallica Reload), #2719 (Metallica Load)
  - LLM gap targets (Mike Portnoy): #2812 (DT Black Clouds), #2798 (DT Falling into Infinity), #2858 (A7X Nightmare, Grammy-nom)
  - LLM gap targets (Lombardo/Kollias): #2814 (Testament The Gathering, Lombardo), #2799 (Nile Those Whom the Gods Detest, Kollias)
  - High-TAM: #2875 (A7X City of Evil, The Rev — breakthrough + LLM anchor), #2870 (Limp Bizkit SO+CSAD, John Otto — GA4 top-6 page signal)
  - GSC CTR signal: #2721 (August Burns Red Rescue & Restore, Matt Greiner — 14.29% CTR)
- **#2715–#2718 watch**: Ralph merged #2860+#2867 post-07:00 — Watcher is healthy. No human-founder escalation — queue depth, not Watcher failure. These 4 issues are mid-queue behind older eligible numbers.

### State delta
- **New ai-fix filed (1):** #2877 (LLM gap prose kit overview — 5 profiles)
- **Promoted (11):** #2767, #2765, #2719, #2812, #2798, #2858, #2814, #2799, #2875, #2870, #2721
- **Backlog: 32→43** (within target band)
- **seo-proposal bank: 200+ held** (idea bank healthy)

### Quota check
✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty. ✅ SEO proposals: triaged (11 promoted 5★, held 4★/3★ for <25 backlog). ✅ L1: first-run, no wins/losses/nulls to process; brann-dailor+shannon-larkin CTR gaps logged in learned-patterns for 2026-07-01 watch. ✅ L2: #2877 filed (1 ai-fix per pattern rule satisfied). ✅ L3: 1.4% indexed share = API sampling artifact confirmed in learned-patterns (2026-06-26 baseline). ✅ #2715–#2718: no escalation (Ralph active). ✅ Decisions logged.

### Next Run (2026-06-27 19:00 UTC)
1. **Zombie sweep** — check for PRs merged since 13:00; close resolved ai-fix issues.
2. **#2715–#2718 watch** — if still 0 Watcher pick-up at 19:00 (~40h), post escalation comment; create `human-founder` at next morning run.
3. **brann-dailor CTR** — if L1 refresh early, check pos/CTR; file title+meta issue if still 0 clicks.
4. **Hold 4★ queue** (promote only when backlog drops to <25): #2857 (IM Book of Souls) → #2862 (Top-10 batch 19) → #2779 (Lick batch 16).

- **Triaged 7 new seo-proposals (#2842–#2848):**
  - **#2842** (CoB Relentless Reckless Forever + I Worship Chaos, Jaska, 2011+2015) — **5★ PROMOTED**: Jaska active GSC (pos 4.8 / 5 impr / 40% CTR / 2 clicks); CoB trio (#2827) just shipped — these 2 albums complete the full CoB arc; final two CoB albums = strong LLM coherence. No duplicate. Backlog: 30→31.
  - **#2845** (Cryptopsy Once Was Not + The Unspoken King, Flo Mounier, 2005+2008) — **5★ PROMOTED**: Flo #1 CTR entity this week (42.86% on "flo mounier drum kit"); Comparison-25 Flo vs Haake just shipped — deeper Cryptopsy cluster naturally follows; None So Vile already live = arc context.

  - **#2847** (Comparison batch 26 — Hoglan/Lombardo + Inferno/Flo + Martin Lopez/Gavin Harrison) — **4★ HOLD**: Hoglan+Lombardo+Inferno+Flo = strong anchors; Martin Lopez and Gavin Harrison have no individual GSC signal yet. 25-44 zone; promote when backlog <25.
  - **#2843** (Behemoth Opvs Contra Natvram, Inferno, 2022) — **4★ HOLD**: closes Behemoth arc to present; Inferno building signal; no active Behemoth album-query GSC data. 25-44 zone.
  - **#2844** (CC Bloodthirst + The Wretched Spawn, Mazurkiewicz, 1999+2004) — **3★ HOLD**: Mazurkiewicz GSC noise-band (3 impr). Park.
  - **#2848** (SoundLike batch 27 — Bill Ward + Martin Lopez + Derek Roddy) — **3★ HOLD**: all 3 entities below GSC signal threshold. Park.
- **Stale #2715–#2718**: now ~19h post re-file (03:15 UTC), 0 Watcher activity. 30h threshold = 09:15 UTC 2026-06-27. No escalation this run — threshold not reached.
- **#2710 (72 Seasons)**: still blocked on #2718 (Hardwired). No change.
- **L1/L2/L3**: no fires. L1 first-run baseline (next actionable 2026-07-01). L2 #2211 open (52/65 uncited). L3 baseline (1.4% indexed share, API cap — no quality crisis).

### State delta
- **Zombies closed (4):** #2827, #2829, #2830, #2838
- **Promoted (3):** #2842 (CoB arc / Jaska 5★), #2845 (Cryptopsy / Flo 5★), #2846 (Lick batch 17 / Hoglan+Lombardo+Menza 5★)
- **Backlog: 34→30 (zombies)→33 (promotions)**

### Quota check
✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty. ✅ SEO proposals: 7/7 triaged (3 promoted 5★, 2 held 4★, 2 held 3★). ✅ Zombies: 4 closed. ✅ L1/L2/L3: no fires. ✅ Stale #2715–#2718: watching (30h threshold at 09:15 UTC 2026-06-27). ✅ Decisions logged.

### Next Run (2026-06-27 07:00 UTC)
1. **Stale escalation** — #2715–#2718 at 28h post re-file (~09:15 threshold); if still 0 Watcher activity, escalate all 4 to `human-founder` immediately.
2. **#2710 (72 Seasons)** — promote once #2718 (Hardwired) ships via PR.
3. **Zombie sweep** — overnight merges likely; close before counting.
4. **4★ queue** (promote when backlog <25): #2847 (Comparison batch 26) → #2843 (Behemoth OCN/Inferno) → then remaining 4★ holds.

## 2026-06-26 19:30 — 3 zombies closed, 7 proposals triaged (3 promoted 5★ — CoB/Jaska, GearEvo-4/Mario, Comparison-25/Flo+Brann), broken-video #2838 noted (31→34)

### Context (≤3 lines)
Evening continuation run. Metrics: 112 users / 128 sessions / 2,808 impr / 74 clicks / 2.64% CTR / pos 8.5 (fresh 2026-06-26 19:31 UTC). Backlog entered at 34. 3 PRs merged 17:36–19:05 UTC (missed by 19:00b) and 7 new seo-proposals (#2827–#2833) surfaced after that run. #2838 (broken YouTube videos ×5) auto-filed by verifier at 18:12 UTC, already has ai-fix — Ralph queue.

### Actions taken
- **Closed 3 zombie issues** (PRs merged 2026-06-26T17:36–19:05Z): #2810 (→PR#2834+#2840 Haake/Chaosphere), #2815 (→PR#2835 SoundLike batch 26), #2816 (→PR#2836 Comparison batch 24). Backlog: 34→31.
- **Triaged 7 new seo-proposals (#2827–#2833):**
  - **#2827** (Children of Bodom trio — Follow the Reaper + Are You Dead Yet? + Blooddrunk, Jaska Raatikainen, 2000/2005/2008) — **5★ PROMOTED**: Jaska = active GSC (5 impr / pos 4.8 / 40% CTR / 2 clicks on "jaska raatikainen drum set", 7 GA4 views); SoundLike batch 26 (#2815) just shipped — album-setup trio is the natural depth layer; CoB cluster has zero article coverage. Backlog: 31→32.
  - **#2829** (Gear evolution batch 4 — Mario Duplantier + Paul Mazurkiewicz + Vinnie Paul) — **5★ PROMOTED**: Mario 32 impr pos 10.0 GSC (top-3 non-Joey entity); Vinnie Paul 22 impr pos 10.4 GSC; proven format (batches 1+2 shipped, batch 3 (#2797) promoted). Paul Mazurkiewicz weaker but carried by Mario/Vinnie anchors. Backlog: 32→33.
  - **#2830** (Comparison batch 25 — flo-mounier-vs-tomas-haake + brann-dailor-vs-eloy-casagrande + jay-weinberg-vs-mike-mangini) — **5★ PROMOTED**: Flo GA4 top-10 + 42.86% CTR; Haake zero-competitor L2 gap (learned-patterns); Brann CTR gap (23 impr pos 6.3 / 0 clicks — Brann-Dailor-pattern); Eloy 19 impr GSC. Three pairs with strong anchors; proven comparison format. Backlog: 33→34.
  - **#2831** (Top-10 batch 18 — melodic-death/deathcore/post-metal) — **4★ HOLD**: proven format; no active GSC signal pulling this batch; deathcore and post-metal are lower TAM for our entity base. Park until <25.
  - **#2832** (Gear price history batch 19 — Brann + George Kollias + Jaska) — **4★ HOLD**: Brann anchor strong (CTR gap); Jaska active; Kollias noise-band (4 impr) drags batch. Wait for Brann/Jaska articles (#2827, #2728) to ship first — deeper cluster coherence before price history. Park.
  - **#2833** (LoG 'VII: Sturm und Drang', Chris Adler, 2015 — Grammy-nominated) — **3★ HOLD**: Grammy LLM hook valuable; Adler only 4 impr pos 8.8 (noise-band GSC). Insufficient signal. Park.
  - **#2828** (Black Sabbath 'Sabotage', Bill Ward, 1975) — **3★ HOLD**: Bill Ward 2 impr 50% CTR (too low volume); no active GSC signal justifying promotion in 25-44 zone.
- **#2838 (broken YouTube ×5)**: auto-filed by verifier, already has `ai-fix` label — Ralph will handle. No CEO action needed.
- **Stale #2715–#2718**: 1 CEO nudge comment each (from 08:15 UTC), 0 Watcher PR activity. Re-filed at ~03:15 UTC; 30h threshold = 09:15 UTC 2026-06-27. ~16h elapsed — no escalation this run.
- **L1/L2/L3**: no fires. L1 first-run baseline (43 new queries surfacing; next actionable 2026-07-01). L2 #2211 open (52/65 uncited). L3 baseline (1.4% indexed share, API cap — not a quality crisis).

### State delta
- **Zombies closed (3):** #2810, #2815, #2816
- **Promoted (3):** #2827 (CoB trio / Jaska 5★), #2829 (Gear evolution batch 4 / Mario+Vinnie 5★), #2830 (Comparison batch 25 / Flo+Brann+Jay 5★)

### Context (≤3 lines)
Evening run (second invocation). Metrics: 112 users / 128 sessions / 2,808 impr / 74 clicks / 2.64% CTR / pos 8.5 (fresh 2026-06-26 16:36 UTC). Backlog entered at 35. 4 new zombies from PRs merged 14:12–16:09 UTC (#2720, #2730, #2775, #2797 all shipped by Ralph since prior 19:00 entry). 7 new seo-proposals (#2810–#2816).

### Actions taken
- **Closed 4 zombie issues** (PRs merged 2026-06-26T14:12–16:09Z): #2720 (→PR#2820/#2809 Gojira Fortitude), #2730 (→PR#2821/#2817 Machine Messiah), #2775 (→PR#2822/#2818 ABR Phantom Anthem), #2797 (→PR#2819 Gear evolution batch 3). Backlog: 35→31.
- **Triaged 7 new seo-proposals (#2810–#2816):**
  - **#2810** (Meshuggah 'Chaosphere', Haake, 1998 — fills DEI→Nothing arc gap) — **5★ PROMOTED**: Haake = zero-competitor L2 gap (per learned-patterns); Chaosphere is the missing link between DEI and Nothing (both live); Meshuggah cluster coherence = LLM anchor. Backlog: 31→32.
  - **#2815** (SoundLike batch 26 — Inferno + Pete Sandoval + Jaska Raatikainen) — **5★ PROMOTED**: Inferno 12 impr pos 7.4 GSC; Pete Sandoval 50% GSC CTR; Jaska 7 GA4 views + 2 GSC clicks; all 3 entities have live signals; proven SoundLike format. Backlog: 32→33.
  - **#2816** (Comparison batch 24 — Hoglan/Eloy + Flo/Pete + Igor/Jaska) — **5★ PROMOTED**: all 6 entities have active GSC/GA4 signals (Hoglan 66% CTR; Eloy 19 impr pos 8.6; Flo GA4 top-10; Pete 50% CTR; Igor 14% CTR lick star; Jaska GA4 active); proven comparison format. Backlog: 33→34.
  - **#2811** (Slayer 'Divine Intervention', Bostaph, 1994 — opens Bostaph era) — **4★ HOLD**: arc opener for Bostaph Slayer run but no active GSC signal on Bostaph; same signal absence that kept #2774 (Repentless) at 3★. 25-44 zone.
  - **#2812** (DT 'Black Clouds & Silver Linings', Portnoy, 2009 — final DT album) — **4★ HOLD**: Portnoy L2 gap + "final DT album" LLM narrative; no active GSC Portnoy signal. 25-44 zone. Promote with #2798 and #2767 batch when slots open.
  - **#2813** (PT 'In Absentia' + 'Deadwing', Gavin Harrison, 2002+2005) — **4★ HOLD**: Gavin Harrison arc fill, PT cluster expansion; no strong GSC signal for Harrison yet. 25-44 zone.
  - **#2814** (Testament 'The Gathering', Lombardo guest, 1999) — **4★ HOLD**: creative cross-band angle (Lombardo outside Slayer); Testament's most acclaimed album; but no Testament-specific GSC signal and Lombardo arc builds primarily in Slayer context. 25-44 zone.
- **Stale #2715–#2718**: 1 CEO nudge comment each, 0 Watcher PR activity. Re-filed at ~03:15 UTC; 30h threshold = 09:15 UTC 2026-06-27. Still within window — no escalation this run.
- **#2710 (72 Seasons)**: still blocked on #2718 (Hardwired) shipping.
- **L1/L2/L3**: no fires. L1 next actionable 2026-07-01. L2 #2211 open (52/65 uncited). L3 baseline unchanged.

### State delta
- **Zombies closed (4):** #2720, #2730, #2775, #2797
- **Promoted (3):** #2810 (Chaosphere/Haake 5★), #2815 (SoundLike batch 26 5★), #2816 (Comparison batch 24 5★)
- **Backlog: 35→31 (zombies)→34 (promotions)**

### Quota check
✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty. ✅ SEO proposals: 7/7 triaged (3 promoted 5★, 4 held). ✅ Zombies: 4 closed. ✅ L1/L2/L3: no fires. ✅ Stale #2715–#2718: watching (30h threshold not yet reached). ✅ Decisions logged.

### Next Run (2026-06-27 07:00 UTC)
1. **Stale escalation** — if #2715–#2718 still 0 Watcher activity at 07:00 (30h since re-file ≈ 09:15 UTC threshold approaching), escalate to `human-founder`; unprecedented for atomic Lars/Nick Menza articles.
2. **#2710 (72 Seasons)** — promote once #2718 (Hardwired) ships.
3. **Zombie sweep** — overnight batch likely; each close frees slots toward 4★ promotion.
4. **4★ queue** (promote when backlog <25): #2811 (Bostaph/Divine Int) → #2812 (Portnoy/Black Clouds) → #2813 (Harrison/PT batch) → #2814 (Lombardo/Testament).

- **Stale watch #2715–#2718** (re-filed 2026-06-26T03:15 UTC; CEO nudge already on each): ~16h since re-file, 0 PR activity — still within watch window (30h threshold = ~09:15 UTC 2026-06-27). No escalation this run.

### Next Run (2026-06-27 07:00 UTC)
1. **Zombie sweep** — overnight merges likely; each close frees slots toward <25 for 4★ promotion.
2. **#2715–#2718 stale watch** — if still 0 Watcher activity (>24h post re-file), escalate to `human-founder` for root-cause investigation; this is unprecedented stagnation.
3. **#2710 (72 Seasons)** — promote once #2718 (Hardwired) ships.
4. **5★ next queue** (promote when backlog drops): #2720 (Gojira Fortitude) → #2730 (Sepultura Machine Messiah) → #2725 (Comparison batch 21).

  - **#2724** (Lick pages batch 14 — Mangini + Travis Orbin + Abe Cunningham) — **4★ HOLD**: proven format; weaker GSC entities vs prior batches. Park.

  - **#2723** (Black Sabbath 'Master of Reality', Bill Ward, 1971) — **4★ HOLD**: doom origin, arc fill, moderate TAM.

Overnight batch of 18 PRs merged 01:18–01:19 UTC — none caught by prior runs (07:00/13:00 only caught earlier batches). Stale escalation: #1895/#1928/#1929/#2096 at 7+ days with ceo-aggressive label, still 0 Watcher activity → re-filed as fresh.

### Actions taken
- **Closed 15 zombie issues** (PRs merged 2026-06-26 01:18–01:19 UTC, missed by all prior runs): #2671 (PR#2707), #2618 (PR#2698), #2619 (PR#2696), #2654 (PR#2695), #2616 (PR#2694), #2617 (PR#2693), #2606 (PR#2692), #2612 (PR#2691), #2614 (PR#2690), #2613 (PR#2689), #2605 (PR#2688), #2507 (PR#2683), #2584 (PR#2682), #2588 (PR#2678), #2586 (PR#2665). Backlog: 35→20.
- **Triaged 5 overnight proposals (#2708–#2714, excluding #2706/#2705/#2703 triaged in prior run):**
  - **#2708** (ABR Constellations, Matt Greiner — fixes 🔴 2 live broken refs on leveler + soundLike guide) → **5★ PROMOTED**: auto-5★ broken ref rule.
  - **#2709** (Slipknot All Hope Is Gone, Joey Jordison 2008 — addresses CEO-flagged #1 GSC content-gap: 106 impr / 0.94% CTR) → **5★ PROMOTED**: directly addresses top content-gap query.
  - **#2713** (Lick batch 13 — Igor Cavalera + Matt Greiner + Charlie Benante) → **5★ PROMOTED**: proven lick-pages pattern (learned-patterns.md).
  - **#2714** (JP Firepower, Scott Travis 2018 — arc fill) → **4★ PROMOTED**: backlog <25 gate open; Scott Travis arc context.
  - **#2710** (Metallica '72 Seasons') → **4★ HOLD**: depends on Hardwired (#2718) shipping first.
  - **#2711, #2712** (Iron Maiden Dance of Death + AMOLATD) → **3★ HOLD**: no Nicko GSC signal.
- **Promoted 5 more un-promoted 5★ broken-ref issues from backlog:** #2582 (Mastodon Leviathan), #2585 (Deftones Diamond Eyes + Koi No Yokan), #2587 (Converge Jane Doe + Axe to Fall), #2603 (soundLike missing — Cosmogenesis/Epitaph/Doomsday), #2604 (soundLike missing — God Hates Us All/Wages of Sin/AaL).

Backlog: 28→40.
- **Stale issue re-filing** (#1895/#1928/#1929/#2096 — 7+ days, ceo-aggressive, 0 Watcher activity): closed all 4 and re-filed as fresh issues #2715 (St. Anger), #2716 (Youthanasia), #2717 (Sound of White Noise), #2718 (Hardwired). Net: backlog 40→36→40, but fresh numbers bubble them to top of Watcher's LIFO queue.
- **L1**: No gsc-watch issue open (first-run baseline). 43 new queries surfacing — key signals: `joey jordison drum set` (134 impr/pos 8.3), `brann dailor drum kit` (23 impr/pos 6.3 — Brann-Dailor pattern), `shannon larkin drum kit` (13 impr/pos 4.8/0 clicks — CTR gap still active).

## 2026-06-26 19:00 — 7 proposals triaged (0 promoted — 1 dup close + 6 zone holds), backlog 35

### Context (≤3 lines)
Evening run. Metrics stale (last fetch 01:44 UTC): 103 users / 119 sessions / 2,246 impr / 58 clicks / 2.58% CTR / pos 8.5. Backlog entered at 35 (25-44 zone). No PRs merged since 13:00.

### Actions taken
- **No zombie closes** — 0 PRs merged since 13:00 UTC.
- **Triaged 7 new seo-proposals (#2699–#2706):**
  - **#2699** (Periphery debut, Matt Halpern — 🔴 broken ref) — **CLOSED as duplicate**: open ai-fix #2145 already covers the same `periphery-self-titled-drum-setup` broken slug ref. No re-file.
  - **#2700** (Pantera 'GSTK', Vinnie Paul 1996 — FBD→GSTK arc fill) — **4★ HOLD**: Vinnie Paul 22 impr pos 10.4 GSC, no broken ref; 25-44 zone.
  - **#2701** (Pantera 'Reinventing the Steel', Vinnie Paul 2000 — closes arc) — **4★ HOLD**: same entity as #2700; arc completion value, no urgent signal; 25-44 zone. Priority after #2700.
  - **#2702** (Iron Maiden 'Fear of the Dark', Nicko McBrain 1992 — arc fill) — **3★ HOLD**: no GSC signal on Nicko; arc fill only.
  - **#2703** (SoundLike batch 22 — Vinnie Paul + Pete Sandoval + Hellhammer) — **4★ HOLD**: Vinnie Paul (22 impr) + Pete Sandoval (50% GSC CTR) strong signals; proven SoundLike format; 25-44 zone.
  - **#2705** (Comparison batch 20 — Shannon Larkin + Hellhammer + Blake Richardson) — **4★ HOLD**: Shannon CTR gap (pos 4.8 / 0 cl) makes this relevant but profile/article fixes take priority; 25-44 zone.
  - **#2706** (Top-10 batch 15 — symphonic/technical/melodic death metal) — **4★ HOLD**: technical death metal sub-niche has good TAM (Haake/Roddy live); 25-44 zone.
- **Stale watch (#1895/#1928/#1929/#2096)**: ceo-aggressive added at 13:00 (~6h). Still 0 Watcher activity. Too soon post-label to escalate further tonight.

### Next Run (2026-06-27 07:00 UTC)
1. **Zombie sweep** — overnight batch likely; each merge frees slots toward 4★ promotion.

## 2026-06-26 13:00 — 4 zombies closed, 7 proposals triaged, 2 promotions + 4 stale escalations (37→33→35)

### Context (≤3 lines)
Mid-day pulse. Metrics: 102 users / 118 sessions / 2,246 impr / 58 clicks / 2.58% CTR / pos 8.5 (slight softening vs yesterday's 2.73% peak — normal daily variance). Backlog entered at 37. 4 overnight zombies missed by 07:00 run (PRs #2650/#2659/#2662/#2676 all merged 2026-06-25T23:53, issues not caught). 7 new seo-proposals (#2669–#2675). Stale issues (#1895/#1928/#1929/#2096) still show 0 Watcher activity after CEO nudge — escalation triggered per 13:00 plan.

### Actions taken
- **Closed 4 zombie issues** (PRs merged 2026-06-25T23:53, missed in 07:00 sweep): #2481 (Seasons in the Abyss→PR#2650), #2546 (Titans of Creation→PR#2659), #2583 (Arise→PR#2662), #2602 (soundLikeGuides.js fix→PR#2676). Backlog: 37→33.
- **Triaged 7 new seo-proposals (#2669–#2675):**
  - **#2669** (Sepultura 'Schizophrenia', Igor Cavalera, 1987) — **5★ PROMOTED**: Igor is #1 GA4 entity (lick pages = 2 of top-10 pages), GSC pos 3.6 for "igor cavalera drum kit". Opens Sepultura arc at origin before Beneath the Remains (✓ in DB). Strong LLM anchor: "pre-endorsement era, Cogumelo Records" unique angle.
  - **#2671** (Gear evolution batch 2: Gene Hoglan + Dave Lombardo + Igor Cavalera) — **5★ PROMOTED**: all three entities have top GSC signals (Hoglan 66% CTR, Lombardo active arc build, Igor GA4 star). Proven gear-evolution format (batch 1 shipped). Backlog: 33→35.
  - **#2670** (Anthrax 'State of Euphoria', Benante, 1988) — **4★ HOLD**: good arc fill (Among Living → State → Persistence), 2× Platinum, but no broken ref and no urgent GSC signal. Promote at <25.
  - **#2673** (Comparison batch 19: Harrison/Carey + Inferno/Mounier + Mangini/Garstka) — **4★ HOLD**: Danny Carey is the anchor (12 impr, pos 17–18) but other pairs are weaker entities. 25-44 zone.
  - **#2672** (Lick batch 12: Gavin Harrison + Scott Travis + Paul Bostaph) — **3★ HOLD**: weaker entities vs batch 11 (Vinnie Paul/Mikkey Dee/Roddy had GSC signals). Park.
  - **#2674** (CC 'Eaten Back to Life', Mazurkiewicz, 1990) — **3★ HOLD**: opens CC arc, Paul Mazurkiewicz on roster, but no GSC signal yet. Promote after Tomb of the Mutilated (#2174) ships and GSC signal develops.
  - **#2675** (SoundLike batch 21: Herrera + Koperweiss + Yeung) — **3★ HOLD**: all entities absent from GSC data. Park.
- **Escalated 4 stale issues** (open >5 days, CEO nudge delivered 2026-06-25, 0 Watcher activity): added `ceo-aggressive` to #1895 (St. Anger), #1928 (Youthanasia), #1929 (Sound of White Noise), #2096 (Hardwired). Watcher should now split or force-pick.

### State delta
- **Zombies closed (4):** #2481, #2546, #2583, #2602
- **Promoted (2):** #2669 (Schizophrenia), #2671 (Gear evolution batch 2)
- **Backlog: 37→33 (zombies)→35 (promotions)**
- **Stale escalated:** #1895, #1928, #1929, #2096 now tagged `ceo-aggressive`

### Quota check

### Next Run (2026-06-26 19:00 UTC)
1. **Zombie sweep** — evening merges likely; each close frees slots.
2. **Shannon Larkin CTR** — pos 4.8 / 0 clicks still; file CTR optimization issue if data doesn't improve by next L1 snapshot (2026-07-01).
3. **Ceo-aggressive watch** — check if Watcher has picked up #1895/#1928/#1929/#2096 after ceo-aggressive label; split if still stuck.
4. **4★ queue** (promote if backlog drops <25): #2508 → #2509 → #2510 → #2607 → #2615 → #2608 → #2652 → #2655 → #2670 → #2673.

## 2026-06-26 07:00 — 2 zombies closed, 7 proposals triaged, 2 promotions (37→35→37)

### Context (≤3 lines)
Morning deep run. Metrics fresh (2026-06-25 23:30 UTC): 121 users / 145 sessions / 2,525 impr / 69 clicks / 2.73% CTR / pos 8.6. Backlog entered at 37. L1 first-run baseline (no wins/losses yet — next actionable 2026-07-01). L3 indexation first run: 7/500 indexed (1.4%) — all others "unknown" (API inspection quota, not true deindex). Two overnight zombies detected: #2660→#2548, #2651→#2544.

### Actions taken
- **Closed 2 zombie issues**: #2548 (lick batch 9 — PR #2660 merged 23:19Z), #2544 (Joey Jordison CTR fix — PR #2651 merged 23:19Z). Backlog: 37→35.
- **#2508 MAYH broken-ref check**: still-life-drum-setup relatedAlbums = [blackwater-park, deliverance] — does NOT reference MAYH. No broken ref. #2508 stays 4★ HOLD, promote when backlog <25.
- **Triaged 7 new seo-proposals (#2652–#2658):**
  - **#2653** (Godsmack 'The Oracle', Shannon Larkin 2010 — #1 Billboard 200) — **5★ PROMOTED**: Shannon is GA4 darling (#2 top page, 11 views) + GSC pos 4.8/13 impr/0 clicks. Extends cluster after #2606 (IV) now shipped.
  - **#2654** (Slayer 'World Painted Blood', Lombardo 2009) — **5★ PROMOTED**: closes Lombardo Slayer arc before 2013 departure. Hell Awaits (#2616) + South of Heaven (live) + Seasons (#2481) → World Painted Blood completes the chain.
  - **#2652** (Megadeth 'Countdown to Extinction', Menza 1992) — **4★ HOLD**: solid arc fill (Rust → Countdown → Youthanasia), no GSC signal on Menza yet. Promote when backlog <25.
  - **#2655** (DT 'Awake', Portnoy 1994) — **4★ HOLD**: arc gap fill, no GSC signal. Promote at <25.
  - **#2656** (SoundLike batch 20 — Luzier/Jaska/Cruz) — **3★ HOLD**: weak entity GSC signals (Jaska noise-band, Luzier absent from GSC). Park.
  - **#2657** (comparison batch 18 — Bostaph/Wallgren/Luzier) — **3★ HOLD**: entities weaker than batch 17 (no GSC signal for Bostaph/Luzier). Park.
  - **#2658** (Top-10 batch 14 — doom/groove/folk) — **3★ HOLD**: folk-metal off-brand for metalforge.io; doom + groove are valid but no urgent signal. Park.
- **Promoted 2 to ai-fix** (backlog 35→37): #2653, #2654.
- **L3 indexation**: first-run baseline logged — 7/500 indexed (1.4%). All 493 "unknown" = GSC inspection API quota, not true deindex. Drummer profile pages (joey-jordison, shannon-larkin, etc.) aren't in the 500-sample but have confirmed GSC impressions — they ARE indexed. No ai-fix needed this run.
- **Stale issues** (#1895/#1928/#1929/#2096): each has 1 comment (CEO nudge from 2026-06-26 19:00 run). Watcher hasn't picked them up yet. No escalation this run — nudge is recent. Will escalate with `ceo-aggressive` at 07:00 2026-06-27 if still stagnant.

### State delta
- **Zombies closed (2):** #2548, #2544
- **Promoted (2):** #2653 (Shannon The Oracle), #2654 (Slayer World Painted Blood)

4. **Shannon Larkin CTR watch** — pos 4.8 / 13 impr / 0 clicks mirrors Joey Jordison pre-fix pattern; file CTR optimization issue if still 0 clicks at next L1 snapshot.

- **#2481 (Slayer Seasons)** promoted: dependency #2477 (South of Heaven) now shipped ✓.
- **#2507 (Sepultura Quadra)** already had `ai-fix` — already counted in backlog.
- **Stale issues**: #1895/#1928/#1929/#2096 all show "CEO nudge 2026-06-26 19:00" comment already added. Ralph still hasn't picked up. These are legitimate atomic articles; Watcher may be deprioritizing by age. Flag for investigation if still stuck after next deep run.

### State delta
- **Zombies closed (13):** #2477, #2451, #2450, #2446, #2442, #2440, #2512, #2505, #2484, #2483, #2482, #2480, #2478

- **#2508 note:** Still Life (#2480) now live — if it references MAYH as previousAlbum, then MAYH missing = 🔴 broken ref → auto-5★. Verify at next run.

### Quota check
✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty. ✅ SEO proposals: 10/10 triaged (8 promoted, 2 held — 25-44 zone only 5★). ✅ Zombie closes: 13. ✅ L1: first-run baseline — no wins/losses; next actionable 2026-07-01. ✅ L2: 52/65 uncited — no new ai-fix (backlog 37, zone restriction). ✅ Decisions logged.

### Next Run (2026-06-27 07:00 UTC)
1. **Zombie sweep** — overnight batch likely; each merge frees a slot toward 4★ promotion threshold (<25).
2. **#2508 broken-ref check** — verify if Still Life article references MAYH as previousAlbum; if yes, auto-5★ and promote.
3. **Priority 4★ queue** (promote when backlog <25): #2508 (Opeth MAYH Lopez) → #2509 (Dimmu ISD Hellhammer) → #2510 (Behemoth ILYA Inferno) → #2607 (Gojira Terra Incognita) → #2615 (Tool Undertow) → #2608 (Opeth Watershed).
4. **Stale escalation** — if #1895/#1928/#1929/#2096 still show 0 Watcher activity by 07:00, consider adding `ceo-aggressive` label to force split or human-founder escalation.

## 2026-06-26 07:00 — 8 zombies closed, 10 proposals triaged, 8 promotions (37→45)

### Context (≤3 lines)
Morning deep run. Metrics stale (last fetch 2026-06-25 00:42 UTC — will refresh next automated run). 8 overnight PRs (#2447–#2461) merged without auto-closing their issues (commit prefix `fix: #NNNN` doesn't trigger GitHub auto-close). L1 still first-run baseline (next actionable 2026-07-01). L2 #2211 unchanged: 52/65 uncited.

### Actions taken
- **Closed 8 zombie issues** (PRs merged overnight, issues still open): #2202 (→PR#2455/#2439), #2330 (→PR#2461), #2269 (→PR#2458), #2306 (→PR#2457), #2299 (→PR#2453), #2323 (→PR#2449), #2271 (→PR#2448), #2300 (→PR#2447). Backlog: 45→37.
- **Triaged 10 new seo-proposals (#2440–#2452):**
  - **#2446** (Lick batch 8 — Portnoy/Halpern/Lopez) — **5★ PROMOTED**: proven GA4 lick format; Portnoy = L2 gap; Halpern 8 impr pos 8.0-9.3 in GSC new queries.
  - **#2442** (Behemoth 'Thelema.6', Inferno, 2002) — **5★ PROMOTED**: Inferno GSC signal (inferno drum kit: 12 impr pos 7.4, 1 click); landmark pre-Demigod album; builds Behemoth cluster.
  - **#2451** (Behemoth 'Zos Kia Cultus', Inferno, 2002) — **5★ HOLD**: Inferno GSC signal; continues Behemoth cluster arc. Slot 1 next.
  - **#2450** (Behemoth 'Satanica', Inferno, 1999) — **5★ HOLD**: arc origin; same Inferno signal. Slot 2 next.
  - **#2440** (Dimmu Borgir 'Death Cult Armageddon', Daray, 2003) — **5★ HOLD**: first Dimmu Borgir article = first-mover in major symphonic BM band. Slot 3 next.
  - **#2452** (Deftones 'Saturday Night Wrist', Abe Cunningham, 2006) — **4★ HOLD**: fills alt-metal arc; limited GSC signal for Abe.
  - **#2444** (Top-10 batch 12 — alternative-metal + best-live) — **4★ HOLD**: proven list format; alt-metal TAM.
  - **#2443** (SoundLike batch 18 — Roddy/Otto/Daray) — **4★ HOLD**: Daray synergizes with Dimmu Borgir content; otherwise niche.
  - **#2441** (Trivium 'Vengeance Falls', Nick Augusto, 2013) — **4★ HOLD**: Trivium cluster; sequence after In Waves ships.
  - **#2445** (Gear price history batch 16 — R.Herrera/K.Talley/T.Yeung) — **3★ HOLD**: low-profile drummers, limited GSC signal.

- **GSC signal alert (no ai-fix — AT CAP):** joey-jordison cluster = 282+ impressions across 5 query variants (pos 7-11, ~0 CTR). Will trigger `ctr-gap-opportunity` in 2026-07-01 L1 snapshot. Root cause likely: page title doesn't front-load "drum kit" / "drum setup" — log for title/meta optimization when slot opens.

### State delta

  - **#2271** SoundLike batch 12 (Garstka, Mikkey Dee, Reinert) — **5★ HOLD**: proven ✅ pattern; Mikkey Dee article just shipped = perfect timing
  - **#2270** Iron Maiden AMOLAD (Nicko, 2006) — **4★ HOLD**: arc fill; less iconic than Powerslave/SiT
  - **#2273** Gear price history batch 12 (Martin Lopez, Gavin Harrison, Flo Mounier) — **4★ HOLD**: proven format, moderate TAM
  - **#2275** Top-10 batch 7 (djent/groove/modern) — **4★ HOLD**: djent AI-citation potential; proven list format
  - **#2274** Comparison pairs batch 11 (Bostaph/Dette, Orbin/Koperweis, Mounier/Yeung) — **3★ HOLD**: niche tech-death, lower TAM than prior batches
  - **#2268** — already promoted above

### State delta
- **PRs merged: 11** (2 bug fix + 8 article/content + 1 FAQ batch) — content live: LoG Sacrament, Shannon Larkin Faceless, Jay Weinberg Gray Chapter + WANYK ×2, Matt Greiner Leveler, Jaska CoB Hate Crew, Mikkey Dee Bastards, Bill Ward Sabbath debut, Slayer Show No Mercy, FAQ for 60 articles, snares bug fix
- **Split #2150 closed:** #2297/#2298/#2299/#2300 (net backlog: 45→36 after merges/close→40 after split adds→45 after promotions)
- **Backlog: 45 — AT CAP** (confirmed)
- **Conflicting PRs queued for retry:** #1843 (Brann CTS), #1895 (Lars St. Anger), #2099 (SoundLike batch 4), #2098 (JP AORT), #2096 (Metallica Hardwired), #1933 (Bostaph GHUA), #1928 (Menza Youthanasia) — 7 issues remain open for Ralph
- **Idea bank depth:** ~36 quality proposals parked (3×5★ new: #2269, #2271 + existing)

## 2026-07-01 22:30 — Cleared stale seo-proposal bank (25 issues): 5 closed as shipped-duplicates, 11 re-scoped, 20 promoted to ai-fix

### Context (≤3 lines)
Deep run. Founder inbox empty. Backlog was 26 (25–44 band, promote-sparingly). The entire untriaged `seo-proposal` bank turned out to be 25 issues all dated 2026-06-24/25 (~1 week stale) — nothing newer has been filed by the SEO Agent since. Two watchdog alerts (#3489) traced to a transient Claude weekly-quota exhaustion ~19:00–19:30 UTC hitting both CEO and Roadie simultaneously — both self-recovered on token reset; no code fix needed, false-alarm re: "Roadie shipped nothing" (7 PRs + merges happened earlier same day, verified via `gh pr list --state merged`).

### Actions taken
- **Duplicate sweep (new failure mode identified):** Because these proposals sat on hold for a week while newer batches shipped, several had been fully or partially implemented under different issue numbers. Verified via direct grep against `packages/frontend/data/*.js`, not just issue-title search. Found:
  - **5 full duplicates → closed** (#2420 Nightmare/Portnoy, #2674 Eaten Back to Life/Mazurkiewicz, #2452 Saturday Night Wrist/Cunningham, #2545 Final Frontier+Book of Souls/McBrain, #2672 lick pages Harrison+Travis+Bostaph) — each cites the exact file+slug already shipped.
  - **11 partial duplicates → re-scoped** (dropped the shipped item(s), retitled `[re-scoped from batch N]`, kept only confirmed-missing items): #2675, #2656, #2549, #2513, #2443, #2426, #2415, #2414, #2389, #2388, #2444. Note #2444 caught a subtler case: `alternative-metal-drummers` collides with the already-live `best-alternative-metal-drummers` (same topic, different slug) — a naming-convention near-dupe, not an exact-slug dupe.
  - **9 clean → promoted as-is:** #2658, #2657, #2445, #2425, #2410, #2416, #2422, #2441, #2550.
- **Delegated the systematic per-item file-grep check to a subagent** (16 batch issues) after manually confirming the pattern on 9 issues myself — kept the review grounded in actual data-file contents, not issue-title assumptions.
- **L1/L2/L3 re-check:** gsc-watch-snapshot.md, indexation-snapshot.md, and llm-citations (#2211) are all still the 2026-06-29 snapshot (no new weekly run since last CEO pass) — no new wins/losses/gaps to log. Joey Jordison GSC content-gap queries (metrics.md flags 96/149 impr, <2% CTR) are already covered by closed fixes #3059/#2867/#2544/#3412 and mid-recovery per `learned-patterns.md`; no duplicate escalation filed. L2 comparative-list citation gap (fastest/best-death/most-innovative/thrash-ranked) already covered by closed #2945; awaits next weekly verifier run.

### State delta
- **Backlog: 26 → 46** (20 promotions, net of 5 closes which were never counted as backlog since ai-fix wasn't applied to them)
- **seo-proposal idea bank: 25 untriaged → 0** (fully drained; root cause of the 2026-06-25 silence found — see Next Run #1)
- **Watchdog #3489:** both alerts traced to transient rate-limit; expect auto-close on next passing check, no manual action taken.

### Quota check
✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty. ✅ SEO proposals: all 25 triaged (0 remaining). ✅ GSC-gap: content-gap queries already covered by shipped fixes, no new escalation. ✅ Atomic split: oldest eligible ai-fix issues are the ones just promoted (all ≤3 deliverables, no split needed); held issues #1822/#1824/#1825/#1239-1241 unchanged, no new staleness signal. ✅ No over-filing (0 new ai-fix filed directly by CEO this run — all 20 were pre-existing proposals promoted). ✅ Decisions logged.

### Next Run (13:00 UTC)
1. **Root cause found for the 0-new-proposals silence:** SEO Agent workflow IS running fine (near-daily, mostly success) but has its own bank-capped gate — 2026-07-01 13:50 run logged "Open seo-proposal count = 78 total / 43 pure-unpromoted... BANK-CAPPED mandate, this run is audit-only." It was self-throttling on its own (higher) count than the CEO's. Since this run drained the pure-unpromoted bank to 0, expect the SEO Agent's next run to resume filing. Verify next run.
2. Confirm watchdog #3489 auto-closed after the next clean CEO+Roadie run.
3. Re-check L1/L2/L3 snapshots for a fresh weekly run (last one 2026-06-29 — overdue by 2+ days for weekly cadence).
4. **Process learning:** proposals held >5 days at cap have measurable risk of becoming stale duplicates as newer batches ship. Consider whether prune-proposals.cjs's 21-day window is too long relative to how fast content ships — flag to `human-founder` only if this recurs.

## 2026-07-01 23:40 (state-confirm — anti-noise hold)
- Backlog: 46 ai-fix · 0 PRs open · proposals untriaged: 0 (only unpromoted seo-proposal is umbrella #2211)
- Org/Sessions/Views (7d): 109 / 158 / 224
- Blockers unchanged: #529 #525 #526 #875 (human-founder) — no re-spam
- Actions: none — hold continues. Backlog ≥45 cap active; every L1/L2/L3-actionable item from the 2026-06-29 snapshot (matt-greiner loss, eloy-casagrande + joey-jordison instruments/kit CTR gaps, hellhammer canonical regression, /drummers+/gear/cymbals+/stats/gear-insights+/isaac-lamb/hardware indexation) is already filed and closed (#3210/#3282/#3412/#3280/#3281/#3413); Roadie merged 20 PRs today clearing the queue to empty.
- Next check: 13:00 UTC — watch backlog drop <45 to resume promoting, and for the overdue L1/L2/L3 weekly refresh (stuck at 06-29 for 2 days).

---

---

## 2026-07-02 03:08 (state-confirm — anti-noise hold)
- Backlog: 20 eligible ai-fix (9 not-yet-started, 11 already have open PRs) · 11 PRs open · proposals untriaged: 0 (only unpromoted seo-proposal is umbrella #2211)
- Org/Sessions/Views (7d): 117 / 135 / 171
- Blockers unchanged: #529 #525 #526 #875 (human-founder) — no re-spam
- Actions: none — Roadie/Ralph drained backlog 46→20 overnight (20 ai-fix closed, 11 PRs in flight). SEO Agent hasn't refilled the bank: its 2026-07-01 19:37 run failed on Claude weekly-quota exhaustion (primary resets Jul 3 03:00 UTC, backup resets 10:00 UTC) — same transient pattern as the 2026-07-01 watchdog false-alarm, self-resolving, no fix needed. L1/L2/L3 still on the 2026-06-29 snapshot; every actionable item from it is already filed and closed (#3210/#3282/#3412/#3280/#3281/#3413).
- Next check: 07:00 UTC deep run — backlog is now <25 (promote-liberally band) but bank is empty, so the real trigger is the SEO Agent resuming after quota reset; also due for the overdue L1/L2/L3 weekly refresh (06-29 → 3 days stale).

## 2026-07-02 07:00 — Deep run: closed 2 stale-duplicate PRs; pipeline confirmed healthy, no new triage needed

### Context (≤3 lines)
Deep run. Founder inbox empty. seo-proposal bank has 0 untriaged (only umbrella #2211). Backlog: 10 eligible ai-fix — well under 25 (promote-liberally band), but nothing new to promote.

### Actions taken
- **Closed 2 duplicate PRs:** #3602 (fix: #3224) and #3601 (fix: #2832) — both targeted issues that were already closed by earlier-merged PRs #3599/#3598 (same batches, "re-scoped"/"completion" titles). Both were DIRTY (conflicting) and would never cleanly merge; closing frees Roadie/Merger cycles instead of retrying forever.
- **L2 re-check (#2211, still 2026-06-29 snapshot):** verified every row in the "Not cited anywhere" table already has shipped content — all drummer-head-term Kit Overview prose batches (#3140/#3188/#3206) are CLOSED, technique pages (double-bass, blast-beat), album-specific articles (Master of Puppets, Reign in Blood, Iowa, Lateralus), and comparative lists (fastest/best-death/most-innovative/thrash-ranked) all exist on disk. Nothing new to file; awaiting next weekly verifier refresh to confirm citation wins.
- **GSC content-gap queries** (metrics.md: joey jordison drum kit/set, impr 78+121, CTR <2%) — already covered by shipped #3059; no duplicate escalation.
- **Atomic-split sweep:** #1822/#1824/#1825 remain on `hold` (Ralph rc=1 retry-loop failures, already CEO-held 2026-06-23, no new signal). #1239/#1240/#1241 remain on `hold` (phase-3, no urgency). No new split candidates — all open ai-fix issues have ≤3 deliverables.

### State delta
- **Open PRs: 9 → 8** (net; 2 duplicates closed, 1 new opened by Roadie in the interim)
- **Backlog: 10 eligible / 16 total ai-fix** (unchanged — healthy, well under cap)
- **seo-proposal bank: 0 untriaged** (unchanged — only umbrella #2211 remains, correctly never promoted directly)

### Quota check
✅ Founder ideas: inbox empty. ✅ SEO proposals: 0 untriaged (nothing to triage). ✅ GSC-gap: already covered, no new escalation. ✅ Atomic split: none needed. ✅ PR conflict resolved: #3602/#3601 closed. ✅ No over-filing (0 new ai-fix filed). ✅ Decisions logged.

### Next Run (13:00 UTC)
1. Watch for the overdue L1/L2/L3 weekly refresh (stuck at 2026-06-29, now 3+ days stale) — confirm the Kit Overview batches (#3140/#3188/#3206) converted to L2 citation wins.
2. Backlog is in promote-liberally band (10 eligible) but bank is empty — real trigger is the SEO Agent resuming proposal filing (was quota-blocked, resets 2026-07-03 03:00 UTC primary / 10:00 UTC backup).
3. If PRs keep landing DIRTY, check whether Ralph is branching from stale main — pattern worth flagging to human-founder only if it recurs beyond normal merge-queue contention.
