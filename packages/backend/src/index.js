    bio: 'Mario Duplantier, born in 1981 in Bayonne, France, is the drummer and co-founder of the critically acclaimed progressive death metal band Gojira, which he formed with his brother Joe Duplantier in 1996. Known for his powerful, precise, and incredibly intense drumming style, Mario combines crushing double bass patterns with complex rhythmic structures that complement Gojira\'s unique blend of death metal and progressive elements. His drumming on albums like "From Mars to Sirius," "The Way of All Flesh," and "Magma" has been praised for its technical excellence and raw energy. Beyond his drumming prowess, Mario is also a talented visual artist who has created artwork for Gojira\'s albums and merchandise. His approach to drumming emphasizes dynamics, groove, and an almost tribal quality that has helped define Gojira\'s distinctive sound.',
